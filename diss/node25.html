<p>
The Pasadena system includes a program for querying remote passive
databases.  This selective extraction of information (<tt><b> sei</tt></b>)
program runs periodically and scans its database of remote servers.
Because the remote database systems have widely varying command
languages and query-message requirements, each server has its own query
message.  The state information stored for each passive source
includes:  
<ul><li> the last query time 
<li> a (possibly dynamic) message to query the remote database 
<li> the query interval 
<li> a log (history) of previous query times 
<li> a log of response times (and failures) 
<li> a log of the number of new items returned for specific 
      responses at specific times
</ul>
<p>
The algorithm to query the remote servers is described in [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210314/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyle89">Wyle89</a>]
and its implementation is described below (section
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210314/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node27.html#implementation">4.4</a>).  When messages arrive back from the remote
databases, the history information for the appropriate remote source
database is updated, and new information items are stored in the local
Pasadena message cache database.  In some cases the query message
itself is changed to specify that only new messages be retrieved from
the remote database.  At certain time intervals, the parameters
affecting the query rate for the remote databases (<img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210314im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img357.gif">, <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210314im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img358.gif">,
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210314im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img359.gif">) are re-calculated for each remote system, and
the query intervals are changed accordingly.
<p>
In addition to <em> passive</em> sources that require Pasadena to query
them, the Pasadena system subscribes to several different remote
systems that automatically send it messages via email.  Pasadena does
not have to query these system to receive messages.
<p>
Pasadena also gathers information from news feeds periodically by a a
general-purpose communications system.  This program is
an example of a parameter-driven, non-interactive terminal emulator
that sends commands to remote interactive systems, and captures the
replies from such systems.  The ``send and expect script'' is stored as
external text, so that changes to the command language or menu
structure of the system being queried do not force changes and costly
re-compilation of the program.  Instead, the expected prompts and
commands to be sent can be changed simply by changing the text file.
This type of program in conjunction with automatic scheduling systems
available from the native operating system is becoming very popular, as
such systems form the basis for agents [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210314/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Kay91">Kay91</a>].
The program captures new messages which have appeared in the passive remote
news system since the last time the program was run.  These items
appear as one large text, in the form of a ``log'' of the dialog
between the querying program and the replies of the system.  The
captured text is then post-processed by a separate program to convert
the message data into a format to be used by the Pasadena system.
<p>
This conversion program filters the output of the dialog from newsfeed
queries, converting each identified item into a separate message for
the Pasadena message database; it then inserts the message into the
database in its proper category.  The services queried often offer
several different newswires; these feeds are further categorized by
topic.  Each topic of each newswire has a separate Pasadena database
category.  The Pasadena database system includes methods for the
automatic creation, retrieval, and expiration (deletion) of individual
messages.  The implementation and strategy is similar to the commercial
system Clarinet [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210314/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Temp92">Temp92</a>] which uses a similar database and
distribution medium for commercial newswire services.
<p>
Having touched upon the methods by which Pasadena extracts and receives
messages from the Matrix, we now present some of the issues in the
actual realization of the subscriber profile model from the last
chapter.
