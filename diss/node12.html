 <a name="overload">&#160;</a>
<a name="532">&#160;</a>
<a name="533">&#160;</a>
<p>
The amplified connectivity<a name="534">&#160;</a> 
to other individuals and retrieval sources
associated specifically with computer mediated 
communication<a name="535">&#160;</a> systems<a name="536">&#160;</a>
but also the Matrix (of inter-connected wide area networks and other
communication systems) in general leads to the reception of too much
unwanted information, a now-common phenomenon called <em> information
overload</em> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205519/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Hilt85">Hilt85</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205519/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Quar90">Quar90</a>].  This phenomenon was actually
encountered quite early in the history<a name="540">&#160;</a> 
of the Matrix [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205519/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Hilt77">Hilt77</a>], but
affected relatively few individuals.  Overload itself and it's
deleterious effects have been compared to living under extremely
crowded conditions; corresponding solutions to the latter problem have
been found to be appropriate for solving the former.  The literature
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205519/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Hilt78">Hilt78</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205519/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Hilt85">Hilt85</a>] also suggests a few automated methods for
overcoming electronic information overload, but most of these methods
are echoes of the same mistakes made repeatedly in the field of IR over
the last 35 years.  These popular mistakes<a name="544">&#160;</a> include:
<ol><li> that a static semantic<a name="546">&#160;</a> network 
  or semantic hierarchy<a name="547">&#160;</a> which is
  artificially imposed on a system with a highly dynamic collection
  will magically allow all users of the system to navigate the message
  collection and find all and only those messages for which they are
  searching,
  <li> that Boolean<a name="548">&#160;</a> search<a name="549">&#160;</a> 
  methods are the perfect way to select messages of interest,
  <li> that indexing, searching, retrieval, and dissemination methods which
  are developed for a few dozen messages will function perfectly well for
  much larger collections,
  <li> that precision and statistically estimated recall are 
  <em> unrelated</em> and a very good way to measure the effectiveness 
  of a system, and
  <li> that ``artificial intelligence''<a name="551">&#160;</a>
  (whatever such a phrase should
  mean) will magically cure all problems of such systems in the very near
  future.
</ol>
Hiltz and Turoff [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205519/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Hilt85">Hilt85</a>] vaguely suggest semantic<a name="554">&#160;</a>
hierarchical organizations, and some ``ordering primitives
<a name="555">&#160;</a>'' based on
the projected audience of a WAN message.  They also suggest that users
develop the skill of skimming<a name="556">&#160;</a> 
messages in order to increase recall.
These suggestions are hauntingly reminiscent of early
failures to improve IR performance [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205519/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Clev91">Clev91</a>].  
Cleverdon<a name="558">&#160;</a> encountered
very similar sentiments during the early 
Cranfield<a name="559">&#160;</a><a name="560">&#160;</a> 
test collection studies;
specifically, the Western Reserve<a name="561">&#160;</a> 
University's Metallurgical Index used a
semantic indexing scheme on a very small collection and failed to
improve retrieval performance.  We believe that a
more productive way to combat information overload is through the
application and refinement of modern IR methods incorporated in an
automatic message filtering system.
<p>
In this chapter, we examined some of the problems and issues involved
in information dissemination, defining some terms and describing
specific aspects of the current state-of-the-art in computer networks,
information retrieval, relevance theory, and electronic information
overload.  We have, however, not yet presented the tools to formalize
retrieval and dissemination models.  In the next chapter, we shall
examine methods for modelling the Matrix and effectively extracting
messages from it.  We also set forth the IR framework<a name="562">&#160;</a>
for the key components of new text comparison algorithms.  Finally, we
shall review a new measurement of the <em> relevance</em> of a communicated
message based on user preference instead of absolute 
pertinence<a name="564">&#160;</a><a name="565">&#160;</a>.
