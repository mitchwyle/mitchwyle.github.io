<p>
We now introduce the notion of using separate retrieval functions
instead of a single information filtering process.  We call these
functions <em> filtering stages</em> and define some parameters for their
application and combination.  Factoring out levels of information
filtering from the overall IR process into independent layers is
advantageous not only because it enhances the
flexibility<a name="3746">&#160;</a> and retrieval capabilities for
subscribers, but also for managing network<a name="3747">&#160;</a>
bandwidth<a name="3748">&#160;</a> and computational resources.
Decomposing<a name="3749">&#160;</a> the filtering<a name="3750">&#160;</a>
process<a name="3751">&#160;</a> into stages<a name="3752">&#160;</a> gives a
subscriber much more flexibility in
formulating<a name="3753">&#160;</a><a name="3754">&#160;</a> a
profile.  Specific aspects of the information need are handled
separately, which provides a <em> structure</em> in the profile.  Evidence
from the literature [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Crof91">Crof91</a>] indicates that such a structure is
advantageous to the retrieval process.  Stages also give a system
architect more degrees of freedom in constructing a filtering service.
Separate stages could, for example, be run on separate processors or
machines.  Network bandwidth can be optimized by positioning filtering
stages providing a large data<a name="3757">&#160;</a> reduction
<a name="3758">&#160;</a><a name="3759">&#160;</a> topologically (in a
networking sense) close to the information source.  Storage and other
computational resources are used more efficiently because only those
information sources with possibly relevant information need be tracked
by a server.

IR ranking<a name="3832">&#160;</a> 
process<a name="3833">&#160;</a>.  Specific patterns are used to retrieve or
eliminate messages independently of their ranking.  Paragraph 
types<a name="3834">&#160;</a>
(see section 2.3) are then designated in order to deliver only
relevant full-text sections or the appropriate message surrogates to
subscribers.
<p>
We turn now to the development of a model for an 
information<a name="3835">&#160;</a> server<a name="3836">&#160;</a>.
We model an information server (IS)<a name="3837">&#160;</a> 
as a dynamic<a name="3838">&#160;</a> 
intermediate<a name="3839">&#160;</a> 
repository<a name="3840">&#160;</a> 
of <a name="3841">&#160;</a>
WAN messages whose purpose is to deliver all and only those messages in the
Matrix which a subscriber <em> prefers</em> to all other available messages.
The <a name="3843">&#160;</a><a name="3844">&#160;</a>
system's <a name="3845">&#160;</a><a name="3846">&#160;</a>
subscribers are the information <em> sinks</em> and the
heterogeneous WAN information providers are the information <em> sources</em>.
In our model, an IS includes methods for optimally and efficiently gathering
information from WAN sources and delivering the 
most ``relevant,'' that is the messages <em> preferred</em>
to all other messages, to its subscribers.
<p>
An <b>IS</b> is composed of a set of system<a name="3850">&#160;</a> 
parameters<a name="3851">&#160;</a>, state<a name="3852">&#160;</a> 
information<a name="3853">&#160;</a> for
tracking remote<a name="3854">&#160;</a> <a name="3855">&#160;</a>
sources <a name="3856">&#160;</a><a name="3857">&#160;</a>
in the Matrix<a name="3858">&#160;</a>, 
a set of subscriber profiles<a name="3859">&#160;</a>, a
momentary<a name="3860">&#160;</a> <a name="3861">&#160;</a>
database of locally cached<a name="3862">&#160;</a><a name="3863">&#160;</a>
WAN messages, and some auxiliary
information<a name="3864">&#160;</a> 
such as article indexes and feature<a name="3865">&#160;</a> 
statistics<a name="3866">&#160;</a>.  Each user
profile contains some general<a name="3867">&#160;</a> 
parameters about the subscriber such as
how to reach him or her, and specific elements for modelling an
information<a name="3868">&#160;</a> need<a name="3869">&#160;</a>:
<p>
<ul><li> First and foremost, a profile contains a set of zero or more topics
  about which the subscriber wishes to be informed.  We call these topics
  <em> queries</em>; <a name="3872">&#160;</a>
  it is important to distinguish these queries from the usual
  <em> query texts</em> associated with other types of information systems.
  Queries in this model contain several parameters in addition to a text.
  These query parameters are described in detail below.
  <li> The second element in a profile is a sequence of 
  extended <em> regular
  expressions</em> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Enge88">Enge88</a>] (see section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node21.html#regex">3.3</a>) in disjunctive
  normal form used to model a subscriber's future<a name="3877">&#160;</a>
  interest<a name="3878">&#160;</a> in possible<a name="3879">&#160;</a> 
  sources of information.  These regular
  expressions are used to match the titles or descriptions of new
  sources of information as they become available.  They are not meant
  to match the actual information within the new sources; rather 
  the name or description of new WAN <em>
  databases</em> which are continually becoming available in the Matrix.
  <li> In order to make the formulation, storage, and processing
  of queries easier, a profile also contains global defaults for all
  non-text parameters in each query.
</ul>
<p>
A query is composed of some user and system 
identification
<a name="3882">&#160;</a>
<a name="3883">&#160;</a>
<a name="3884">&#160;</a>
<a name="3885">&#160;</a>
information, a query<a name="3886">&#160;</a> text<a name="3887">&#160;</a> 
of unlimited length which the subscriber may
change frequently, and the following parameters:
<p>
<ul><li> The number of messages in a retrieval set to be delivered;
  <a name="3889">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3890">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3891">&#160;</a>
  <li> The time interval between deliveries;
  <a name="3892">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3893">&#160;</a>
  <li> A set of one or more remote WAN database categories:
  <a name="3894">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3895">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3896">&#160;</a>
  These categories map directly to existing, distinct 
  WAN<a name="3897">&#160;</a> databases to be used as a 
  retrieval<a name="3898">&#160;</a> source;
  <li> Zero or more 
  inclusion<a name="3899">&#160;</a> 
  patterns<a name="3900">&#160;</a>;
  these <a name="3901">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3902">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3903">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3904">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3905">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3906">&#160;</a>
  patterns are also extended
  regular expressions in disjunctive normal form.  These inclusion patterns are
  designed to be a highly specific template which will match a very small
  set of messages that the subscriber prefers above all other possible
  messages, regardless of their similarity to the text portion of the
  query.  These patterns are typically the name of a specific individual or
  a very exact (and therefore long) phrase;
  <li> Zero or more exclusion patterns; these patterns are once again
  <a name="3907">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3908">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3909">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3910">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3911">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3912">&#160;</a>
  extended regular expressions OR'd together in disjunctive normal form.  
  Exclusion
  patterns are designed to filter out specific messages which have a high
  syntactic similarity to a query text but little semantic correspondence.
  For example, if a subscriber is interested in pixel orientation in object
  recognition systems, she would not want to see messages about object
  oriented programming languages or the recognition received by
  object oriented database companies;
  <li> A set of one or more <em> paragraph types</em> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Hort87">Hort87</a>] to 
  be <a name="3915">&#160;</a>
  be <a name="3916">&#160;</a>
  displayed in the messages sent from the <b>IS</b>.
</ul>
<p>
An <b>IS</b> uses the union of all 
database<a name="3918">&#160;</a> categories of all queries of all
subscribers as the sources in the Matrix<a name="3919">&#160;</a> 
for messages to cache in its<a name="3920">&#160;</a>
local database <b>DB</b>.  As the database categories change in the queries
of the user profiles in an <b>IS</b>, the sources queried by the <b>IS</b> change
accordingly.  <b>DB</b> also changes as older messages are deleted from the
<b>IS</b> cache and as new messages arrive.
<p>
Using these parameters<a name="3921">&#160;</a> 
we <a name="3922">&#160;</a><a name="3923">&#160;</a>
define retrieval and <em> filtering stages</em>
for messages in the Matrix.
<p>
A filtering stage is simply a function which selects a subset from a
set of messages.  If <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img171.gif"> and <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img172.gif">,
then it follows trivially, that <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img173.gif">, the power set of
<b>A</b>.  <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img174.gif">.
<p>
Filtering stages are monotonic<a name="3930">&#160;</a>,
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img175.gif"><p>
idempotent<a name="3931">&#160;</a>
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img176.gif"><p>
and obey ``contraction<a name="3932">&#160;</a>''<a name="3933">&#160;</a>
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img177.gif"><p>
<p>
Because of the above properties, the sequential application of filtering
stages is commutative<a name="3934">&#160;</a>:
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img178.gif"><p>
Applying two stages in parallel<a name="3941">&#160;</a> 
to <a name="3942">&#160;</a>
the same message set will, of
course, result in the union of their resulting sets.  We therefore
denote the <em> parallel application</em> of filtering stages as: 
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img179.gif"> 
which means that <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img180.gif"> results from the parallel application of 
filtering stages <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img181.gif"> and <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img182.gif"> to the set of messages <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img183.gif">.
<p>
We shall now consider some properties of the sets resulting from the
application of filtering stages and the relationships among these
sets.  These properties can be used to check the viability and
operating bounds of filtering functions <em> after</em> their application.
As we shall see in the following discussion, the result of these tests
can then be used to signal warnings and suggest changes to filtering
functions based on undesired results.
<p>
We examine three classes<a name="3952">&#160;</a> 
of overlap<a name="3953">&#160;</a> among the sets of messages
resulting from separate filtering stages.  A pair of message sets can be:
<a name="3954">&#160;</a>
<ul><li> <b> disjoint</b>:  Two sets of messages are disjoint when they 
  contain no <a name="3957">&#160;</a>
  elements in common <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img184.gif">.
  <li> <b> semi-orthogonal</b>:  <a name="3961">&#160;</a>
  Two <a name="3962">&#160;</a>
  sets are semi-orthogonal when they 
  are either disjoint, or contain some elements in common, but are 
  not identical, <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img185.gif">.
  <li> <b> unrestricted</b>:  There <a name="3966">&#160;</a>
  is no restriction on the sets; they
  may be identical, overlapping, or disjoint.
</ul>
Obviously, these classes are hierarchical.  All pairs of disjoint sets
are semi-orthogonal and all pairs of semi-orthogonal sets are
unrestricted.
<p>
The filtering stages constructed by the inclusion pattern and the
complement of the exclusion pattern (described above) are designed to
produce either identical or semi-orthogonal answer sets.  If the answer
sets are disjoint, their sequential application would result in a
completely empty answer set.  Although this situation may indeed be
desired by the subscriber, it can often be an indication that the
patterns composing one or both of the filtering stages is too broad or
too specific.  In such a situation, a warning can be issued by the
system to indicate that one or both of the filtering stages may need
changes.  Similarly, the filtering stage resulting from the query text
and an IR algorithm is designed to be semi-orthogonal to the set
resulting from the application of the exclusion<a name="3968">&#160;</a>
stage.  If the resulting sets of the application of these stages are
disjoint, it is likely that the exclusion stage is too broad.
<p>
<p><a name="4175">&#160;</a><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img186.gif">
<br><strong>Figure 3.2:</strong> Filtering sequentially in stages <a name="filter">&#160;</a><br>
<p>
Figure <a href="node20.html#filter">3.2</a> broadly outlines a typical example of sequentially
filtering in stages; only those stages producing a reduction in data
volume are depicted and the data volumes are approximate.  
<a name="4100">&#160;</a>
<p>
We now address the filtering process<a name="4101">&#160;</a> somewhat
<a name="4102">&#160;</a> more precisely.  We shall define four
distinct filtering stages, their application, and a recommended order
for their combination.  The motivations for, and therefore the
definitions of these stages are based on an analysis of subscriber <em>
preferences</em>, both explicit and surmised (conjectured), of sets of
messages in the Matrix.  In the following, we examine the sets of
messages in the Matrix which are or would be preferred by subscribers
to all others, the subset of Matrix messages cached in an <b>IS</b>, and the
subset of <b>IS</b> messages actually delivered to subscribers, as well as
changes to these sets with time.
<p>
Although, in general, filtering stages operate on the set of messages
in the entire Matrix<a name="4104">&#160;</a> 
(<img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img187.gif">), it <a name="4105">&#160;</a> is convenient to restrict some of
them to range only over the set of messages cached in an information
server (<b>DB</b>).<a name="4106">&#160;</a>  
Obviously, <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img189.gif">.  Defining a filter
operating on <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img190.gif"> to produce <b>DB</b> is the first step in defining an
<b>IS</b> and one of the most important considerations.
<p>
Consider the momentary set of all WAN information items <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img191.gif"> in the

<p>
Using these sets of conjectural preferences it is possible to
define theoretical <em> coverage recall</em> and coverage precision
indicators.<a name="6096">&#160;</a><a name="6097">&#160;</a><a name="6098">&#160;</a>
The <em> coverage precision</em>   <b>CU</b>  
and <em> coverage recall</em>   <b>CR</b>   indicators of an <b>IS</b> with respect
to the Matrix at time <b>t</b> are simply 
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img229.gif"><p>
This analysis ignores conjecturally preferred messages that are not
contained in the Matrix.  It is important to distinguish these coverage
indicators from the traditional usefulness, precision, and recall.  The
latter three measures are determined by using relevance judgements from
users or standard collections; they are measured only with respect to
messages contained in an <b>IS</b>.  The former ratios indicate how well an
<b>IS</b> retrieves messages from those available.  Although it is practically 
impossible to <em> measure</em> such parameters, crude estimations are 
possible [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Giff90">Giff90</a>].
<p>
Without loss of generality, we consider for the moment the information
need of a single subscriber <b>s</b> at time <b>t</b>.  The postulated optimal
set of messages <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img230.gif"> contains the <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img231.gif">
messages which <b>s</b> prefers to all others available
at time <b>t</b>.  We again restrict ourselves to <b>t</b> such that <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img232.gif">.  To model <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img233.gif"> a user-profile contains
one or more queries.  Each query contains a list of databases
categories which maps directly to databases to be searched; each query
also contains a pattern (actually an extended  <em> regular expression</em>; 
see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node21.html#regex">3.3</a>), to match new databases when they become available.
These parameters comprise the first filtering stage <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img234.gif">.  This stage

other stages, and therefore <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img241.gif"> does not necessarily ever have
to exist outside of a filter<a name="6124">&#160;</a> 
pipeline<a name="6125">&#160;</a> (a group of sequentially applied
filtering stages).
<p>
Each query also has a parameter specifying the number of messages to
be retrieved.  The subscriber <b>s</b> therefore specifies <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img242.gif">

in equations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#eqwtipd">2.15</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#eqwtipdn">2.16</a> (from 
section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#secstruc">2.3</a>) as part of the term weighting scheme.  Another
approach is to specify the paragraph types directly in <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img294.gif">,
and <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img295.gif">.  We believe that <em> combining</em> these schemes provides
the most flexible and therefore most effective method for selecting
messages for delivery to <b>s</b>.
<p>
The relationships among the set of messages resulting from <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img296.gif"> and
the sets resulting from the other stages are as follows.  <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img297.gif">
and <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img298.gif"> are unrestricted.  <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img299.gif"> and <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img300.gif"> are
unrestricted.  <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img301.gif"> and <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img302.gif"> are semi-orthogonal.
<p>
The final filtering pipeline for generating a set of messages at time
<b>t</b> for subscriber <b>s</b> in <b>IS</b> is:
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img303.gif"><p>
<a name="6381">&#160;</a>
<p>
A final post-processing filtering action<a name="6382">&#160;</a> 
is defined by a query-specific
parameter that specifies a list of paragraph<a name="6383">&#160;</a> 
types to be included in
each message delivered to <b>s</b>.  It also indicates the 
order<a name="6384">&#160;</a><a name="6385">&#160;</a> in which
these paragraphs should appear when the message is delivered.  The
subscriber can thereby filter out unwanted 
header<a name="6386">&#160;</a> paragraphs<a name="6387">&#160;</a> and
directly control the size and order of the summarizing paragraphs of
each message delivered.
<p>
It is preferable to rank and retrieve only information items that have
potential<a name="6388">&#160;</a> 
relevance<a name="6389">&#160;</a> 
to a query because of the large and exponentially
growing number of messages available.  The reason for this preference is
simply an efficiency issue.   Narrowing down the set of messages to
be ranked using the stages <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img304.gif"> through <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img305.gif"> is therefore
conceptually superior to a simple single-stage ranking method.  The
explicit elimination of messages containing a specific pattern directly
reduces the fallout and therefore enhances precision performance.
<p>
There is some evidence to support the hypothesis that filtering in
stages is more effective than one-stage paradigms [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt90">Salt90</a>],
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Mans92">Mans92</a>].  Salton and Buckley, though not concerned with
filtering <em> per se</em> propose a two-stage similarity measure in which
the similarity between a query text and message is calculated by
applying two separate functions in sequence.  In discussing the
benefits of this method, they speculate that ``this precision
performance may be improvable by using additional matching criteria
for low level constructs.''  In other words, by adding another stage
to their overall similarity measure.  In the same work, they also
conjecture that ``restricting the collection search to items located
within the same text cluster <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img306.gif"> might also produce somewhat
enhanced performance measurements.''  It seems that they find
filtering in stages an idea worthy of further pursuit.  Mansfield et.
al. use hardware methods for sequential filtering stages.  They claim
that ``Efficient processing of complex associative search queries
enables services that are impractical using conventional database
system approaches.''  Their use of filtering stages is implemented in
hardware and is applied to optimize distributed database applications
in telephone and cable television networks.
Filtering in this manner is in any case more flexible for network and
computing resource allocation [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Lee88">Lee88</a>].
<p>

<p>
With the growth and increased use of the Matrix, there has been a
resurgence in studies of methods for so-called <em> 
resource<a name="6396">&#160;</a>
discovery<a name="6397">&#160;</a></em>, 
a concept which has migrated from the field of 
library<a name="6398">&#160;</a>
science to the WAN literature in computer science [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210012/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Danz91">Danz91</a>].  Use
of the query-specific profile parameter which matches new database
categories as new WAN databases become available addresses precisely
this issue:  when an <b>IS</b> gains access to new source databases in the
Matrix, subscribers whose queries contain a pattern which matches the
text of the name or description of these new databases are
automatically informed of the existence of the new source.  Thus an
<b>IS</b> can facilitate resource discovery among its subscribers in a
similar fashion to the way messages themselves are disseminated.  The
pattern for matching the descriptions of new databases as they become
available is another parameter designed to satisfy conjectural
preferences normally associated with the classical recall measure.  An
<b>IS</b> does not necessarily add new databases to queries automatically.
Instead, the subscribers themselves choose which databases to add to
their queries.  However, subscribers will be informed about all new
databases matching their filter specification.  The system has therefore
automated much of the resource discovery process.
<p>
In this section, we presented the notion of distinct filtering stages
within an <b>IS</b>, motivating their definition by retrieval effectiveness
considerations.  Some of these stages were defined via extended regular
expressions.  The formal definition of these regular expressions
appears in the next section.
