<p>
The problems associated with the communication and retrieval of
recorded information have been under investigation in one way or
another since the earliest recorded times in western civilization.
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Swan88">Swan88</a>].  The interrelated phenomena of information storage,
communication, access, indexing, reduction, overload, assessment, and
even the theory and definition of information itself all play important
r&#244;les in diverse solutions to the same fundamental problem of
effectively filtering and disseminating information.  The issues
involved are at the same time complex and simple, solvable, and
untenable, broad and specific.  In this dissertation, we propose new
methods to address this age-old exigency, integrating the use of wide
area network (WAN) communication with modern information retrieval (IR)
algorithms.  The viability of our methods is demonstrated in an
implementation of a subscription service called Pasadena (<b>
P</b>eriodic, <b> a</b>synchronous <b> s</b>elective extr<b> a</b>ction and <b>
d</b>iss<b> e</b>mination of information through <b> n</b>etwork <b> a</b>ccess)
which provides a new type of solution to the ancient IR problem.
<p>
Vannevar Bush's<a name="40">&#160;</a> paper ``As We May Think''<a name="41">&#160;</a>
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Bush45">Bush45</a>] is usually taken as the starting point for the intensive
research in information science which lead to the creation and
explosive development of such fields as hypertext <a name="43">&#160;</a>,
databases<a name="44">&#160;</a> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Smit91">Smit91</a>], and IR<a name="46">&#160;</a>.
(Condensed histories of the creation, evolution, and citation patterns
in these fields appear in [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Swan88">Swan88</a>], and [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Smit81">Smit81</a>].)  However,
much thought and effort was dedicated to the improvement of information
systems for millennia before Bush's postulated memex machine.  In fact,
Aristotle, Plato<a name="49">&#160;</a>, and Cicero<a name="50">&#160;</a> produced
important insights into these issues long before computers came along.
Bush's memex and the subsequent developments in computer science have
concentrated almost all modern efforts on the development of automatic
indexing<a name="51">&#160;</a> and passive<a name="52">&#160;</a>
retrieval systems.  The problem of reading information
overload<a name="53">&#160;</a>, and the blind application of
simple, automatic computer solutions to complex IR problems have given
rise to a generation of software which addresses neither user
requirements<a name="54">&#160;</a> nor the fundamental underlying
information dissemination<a name="55">&#160;</a> problems.
Priority has been given to ``information management''
<a name="56">&#160;</a> instead of
information filtering, analysis or promulgation
<a name="57">&#160;</a>.
<p>
Another contributing factor to the dilemma is an unfortunate deficiency
in the analysis of the influence that communicated information has on
recipients.  More specifically, there is a scarcity of useful
operational methods which systematically measure user-satisfaction
<a name="58">&#160;</a> and effectiveness<a name="59">&#160;</a> of
information communication<a name="60">&#160;</a>.  Investigations into
the motivation and purpose for information communication have been
neglected; even simple measurements of information relevance and
preference are used inconsistently or informally in the literature.  It
is well known that assessing information value<a name="61">&#160;</a>
cannot be measured objectively.  There has therefore been a subtle
shift of emphasis away from information significance towards ``data''
manipulation<a name="62">&#160;</a>, which causes the <em>
worth</em><a name="64">&#160;</a> and
effectiveness<a name="65">&#160;</a> of ideas, notions or views to
be concepts for which categorization<a name="66">&#160;</a> and
judgement<a name="67">&#160;</a> are avoided.  As a direct result of this
intentional avoidance, issues such as the
motivation<a name="68">&#160;</a> for and
success<a name="69">&#160;</a> of communicated messages are
ignored.  Information filtering based on the immediate
value<a name="70">&#160;</a> of information becomes almost impossible
under such conditions.  There is weighty evidence in the literature
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Bern79">Bern79</a>] [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Scha90">Scha90</a>] that these difficult issues must be
addressed in order to implement better solutions to the IR problem.
Bernier<a name="73">&#160;</a> and Yerkey<a name="74">&#160;</a> spend three chapters
outlining the ``cultural disasters''<a name="75">&#160;</a> resulting
from the lack of cogency<a name="76">&#160;</a> <a name="tex2html32" href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/footnode.html#77"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="gif" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217im_/http://vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/images/foot_motif.gif"></a> in information
science.  Schamber<a name="78">&#160;</a> et. al. argue for radically new
definitions of relevance<a name="79">&#160;</a> 
which incorporate rhetorical qualities of
communication<a name="80">&#160;</a> in order to improve IR models.
<p>
Part of the purpose of this dissertation, therefore, is the
consideration of communication <em>
effectiveness</em><a name="82">&#160;</a> as this issue relates
to information filtering<a name="83">&#160;</a> and
dissemination.  Recently, in the academic discipline of IR, a general
consensus has formed that there is an urgent need for more and better
relevance measurements<a name="84">&#160;</a> to improve the overall
effectiveness of IR systems [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Frei91">Frei91</a>]<a name="86">&#160;</a>.  We shall
present the application of a new model of retrieval performance
measurement in our development of better indexing and retrieval
algorithms for selective dissemination of information (SDI) systems
based on messages in WANs.
<p>
From our discussion thus far, we beg the questions, ``what do current
approaches miss in their considerations of communication<a name="87">&#160;</a>
effectiveness?'' and ``what <em> tangible</em> benefits arise for real
systems by re-examining these issues?''  Analyzing and incorporating
effectiveness considerations into the design of new models for
information systems is essential to their success at delivering all and
only that information needed (or preferred) by the individuals who use
them.  Our argument is that most existing models, because they are
based on an inappropriate retrieval performance evaluation paradigm,
are not effective at solving the underlying problems for which they are
constructed, namely predicting and delivering that information which is
preferred to all other available information.  We contend that part of
the performance problem in IR is due to the inappropriate, prevailing
methods for measuring retrieval performance.  The benefits that can be
attained by incorporating an analysis and measurement of
user-preference<a name="89">&#160;</a> into 
new IR- and user-models are as follows:  First and
foremost, a system can be better optimized for retrieval performance if
the performance is measured in terms of criteria which are closer to
the real motive for the system's development (sending messages which a
receiver prefers).  Secondly, the empirical evidence gathered is more
easily reproducible when effectiveness 
measures<a name="90">&#160;</a> based on preferences
are used instead of measures based on absolute relevance 
judgements<a name="91">&#160;</a>.
Finally, the method we employ includes an error probability calculation
which is very helpful in experimental evaluation of algorithm
performance<a name="92">&#160;</a>.
<p>
Current approaches to solving IR problems fall into two paradigms,
active search and selective dissemination of information (SDI).
<a name="93">&#160;</a><a name="94">&#160;</a>  In the
former model, a user is supposed to search in several different source
databases for messages which are ``relevant'' to the user's momentary
information need<a name="95">&#160;</a>.  
Systems based on the latter paradigm use very simple
(and therefore lower retrieval performance) methods for comparing a
query text to individual messages.  As we shall see in 
section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node20.html#stages">3.2</a>, our
approach is to combine modern IR searching<a name="97">&#160;</a> 
methods (including new refinements which we developed) 
with a more sophisticated selective
dissemination of information (SDI) model in order to enhance the
effectiveness of a subscription service<a name="98">&#160;</a>.  
The methods we shall present
in the next two chapters are beneficial both to information service
providers<a name="99">&#160;</a><a name="100">&#160;</a>
<a name="101">&#160;</a>
(information brokers) and to information 
consumers<a name="102">&#160;</a><a name="103">&#160;</a>
(subscribers).  Subscribers gain advantages through using these methods
because of the flexibility and increased retrieval performance they
provide.  An information provider gains two distinct advantages by
using our models instead of existing approaches.  First of all, useless
and redundant information<a name="104">&#160;</a> 
sources<a name="105">&#160;</a> are automatically eliminated,
producing a drastic reduction in storage requirements<a name="106">&#160;</a> 
for the
information service provider.  Secondly, computing and network
resources<a name="107">&#160;</a><a name="108">&#160;</a> 
can be minimized by optimizing the configuration of separate
filtering stages (discussed in chapter 3).  Tangible benefits of the
models we are about to present include increased 
efficiency<a name="109">&#160;</a><a name="110">&#160;</a> for
networked SDI systems, more automation of the SDI process (a savings in
tedious labour), and significantly increased retrieval performance for
subscribers.  These benefits can be realized directly in the
construction of new electronic subscription services.  A prototype
example of such a service is presented in chapter 4.
<p>

<p>
A reconsideration of the ancient issue of rhetoric and the specific
matter of cogency is necessary not only for the useful definition of
the key concept of relevance, but also for defining and measuring
retrieval performance and user-satisfaction of retrieval systems.  In
the next chapter we shall briefly sketch out a simple way of measuring
cogency and strategies for increasing system performance based on the
measure.
<p>

<p>
In this thesis, we shall introduce the concept of filtering in
stages<a name="111">&#160;</a><a name="112">&#160;</a><a name="113">&#160;</a>,
and characterize specific properties for their effective construction
and application. We also discuss certain
dependencies<a name="114">&#160;</a> among these stages.  A new
term weighting scheme is applied in one filtering stage which produces
significant retrieval performance improvements.  A new phrase generation
technique is also developed for creating better indexing features from
queries and messages.  We also introduce a
novel user-model which forms the basis of the design and prototype
implementation of an electronic information service.  This system
solves the specific heretofore unsolved problem of finding the preferred
WAN messages among collections with (<img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img7.gif"> to <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img8.gif">) messages.  The
passive user model provides a possible solution to the still unresolved
problem of making complicated but powerful features of sophisticated
information systems available to more users, including novices.  The
concept of separating distinct filtering stages out of the overall
retrieval and dissemination process adds more flexibility to existing
solutions to the IR problem.  The decomposition<a name="115">&#160;</a>
also creates the possibility of running certain stages in
parallel<a name="116">&#160;</a> on separate processors and at different parts
of a WAN.  As we shall see in section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205217/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node20.html#stages">3.2</a>, this flexibility
allows for a much more efficient use of the network
bandwidth<a name="118">&#160;</a><a name="119">&#160;</a> and processors; it
therefore allows for certain unsolved problems arising from bandwidth
or storage<a name="120">&#160;</a> limitations to be solved.  The most important
solution made possible through the new methods we shall present is in
the struggle against reading<a name="121">&#160;</a> information
overload.  Our filtering methods reduce data volume<a name="122">&#160;</a>
to the exact level specified by an individual.
