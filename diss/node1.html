<p>
I would like to thank professor F. P. Waguespack for providing me with the
opportunity to complete this dissertation.
<p>
Special thanks go to my wife for inspiration, intellectual
companionship, patience, persistence, and critically listening to some
weird ideas.
<p>
I must also thank the members of the research teams on which I have
participated during the course of this work for discussions, tips, and
general support.  Martin Eichenberger, Daniel Stieger, Bernd Teufel,
Peter Sch&#228;uble, Gladys Wong, Bruno Z&#252;rcher Yonngang Qiu, Stephan
Meienberg, Olivier Lorenz, and many others in Z&#252;rich were very
helpful.  I really enjoyed our discussions and the helpful exchange of
ideas.  More recently, I have enjoyed fruitful discussions with 
the ``petabyte surfers,'' including Jonny Goldman, Hans Reiser, Randy 
Collins, and Jeff Allen.
<p>
Finally, I would like to thank the other individuals who have all
contributed in some way to the production of this dissertation.  Werner
Almesberger wrote the core program and deserves a lot of praise.  Armin
Kenel built the client - server user interface systems which gives the
system it's interactive appearance.  His programs are of very high
quality.  Peter G&#252;tler helped me build the core information retrieval
modules upon which many other people implemented the retrieval
algorithms used in the system.  Werner Uhrig was always there when I
needed him and provided a lot of moral support.  All of these people
deserve my warmest thanks and grattitude.
