<a name="aperiodic">&#160;</a>
<a name="586">&#160;</a>

<p>
In order for an information server effectively to query the large
number of heterogeneous passive information sources in the Matrix, it
requires a model which accounts for the following factors:
<a name="588">&#160;</a>
<a name="589">&#160;</a>
<a name="590">&#160;</a>
<a name="591">&#160;</a>
<ul>
<p>
  <li> the rate that new information becomes available for query at a
<a name="593">&#160;</a>
<a name="594">&#160;</a>
<a name="595">&#160;</a>
<a name="596">&#160;</a>
  remote database 
  <li> the delay between issuing a query and obtaining a result 
  <li> the probability that a query message or its result
  message will be lost<a name="597">&#160;</a><a name="598">&#160;</a>
  <a name="599">&#160;</a>
</ul> 

<p>
In the following query scheduling<a name="601">&#160;</a> 
model<a name="602">&#160;</a>, we assume that information
somehow flows<a name="603">&#160;</a> into passive<a name="604">&#160;</a> WAN database systems, and is then made
available for query.  An optimal query schedule will allow the
extractor<a name="605">&#160;</a> 
program, that is the information service which is querying
the remote WAN database, to obtain information at the same rate as it
arrives at the server.  Obviously some delay<a name="606">&#160;</a> 
is inevitable since the
source information is not instantly available. We assume that the rate
of information <em> flow</em> however, is approximately the same over some
time interval.  Querying too often would result in many empty or
redundant<a name="608">&#160;</a> answers.  
Querying too infrequently would result in large,
infrequent ``bursts<a name="609">&#160;</a>'' of information<a name="610">&#160;</a> 
at the extractor, and large
intervals of time where the extractor's 
information<a name="611">&#160;</a> is out of date.
More importantly, part of the information in such bursts is already
old when they arrive at the extracting system.  Since WAN
communications bandwidth<a name="612">&#160;</a>
can be expensive, and since the clients of
every SDI service prefer current information, neither of these
situations is desirable.
<p>
Measuring the arrival rate, i.e. the rate at which information arrives
at the passive server is the usual approach.  However, from the
extractor's point of view, a more important parameter is the rate that
the information becomes available for querying.  These two rates are
not identical because the passive database source server must 
update<a name="613">&#160;</a>
the information to make it available for query.  We shall call this
<em> update rate</em> <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img12.gif"><a name="615">&#160;</a>
and define it to be the number of<a name="616">&#160;</a>
information items which the server makes available for querying per
unit time.  This rate may indeed be different from the arrival rate,
but since the extractor has no control over the indexing process at the
passive database source, this latter parameter must take precedence.
Thus, using the extractor's perspective we shall take a
phenomenological ``black box'' approach.<a name="617">&#160;</a>
<p>
Without loss of generality, we consider each passive WAN server (figure
2.1) separately, and optimize a scheduling rate for an individual one.
Let <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img14.gif"> <a name="618">&#160;</a> 
(with units of queries per unit time) be the rate at which
the extractor sends queries to the server.  The <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img16.gif"> parameter is
designed to allow an extractor to mirror a remote 
information<a name="619">&#160;</a><a name="620">&#160;</a>
source.  Hence, it is desirable
that an extractor<a name="621">&#160;</a> <a name="622">&#160;</a>
querying at a rate <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img17.gif"> retrieve information as
soon as it becomes available.  Therefore, if <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img18.gif"> is optimal it
will allow an extractor to retrieve, on average, precisely one message
per query.  Retrieving more than one message decreases the 
timeliness<a name="623">&#160;</a>
and therefore the isomorphism of the model<a name="624">&#160;</a>.  
If messages queue<a name="625">&#160;</a>
at a server and become available for query in groups, it is impossible
for a single query to return exactly one information item; it is,
however, possible for the average query rate<a name="626">&#160;</a> 
over time to produce one
item per query.  Bursts of available items at a server will lead to
cases where this definition of an optimal <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img19.gif"> would cause a
system <a name="627">&#160;</a><a name="628">&#160;</a>
to send several queries which retrieve zero items.  A burst size <b>b</b>
leads to the following ``optimal'' scenario, where the average number
of <a name="629">&#160;</a>
items retrieved over time is one but many more queries are 
sent:  <p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img22.gif"><p>
Defining an optimal <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img23.gif"> to be a rate which allows an extractor to
retrieve items just after each update<a name="632">&#160;</a> 
at a remote server would
therefore be more efficient.  However, experience indicates that burst
sizes are usually very small, and that sporadic updates rates, large
burst sizes, or server unavailability are not common; therefore
optimizing for one item retrieved per query provides a more useful
method than one query per server update.
<p>
If, on average, an <a name="633">&#160;</a><a name="634">&#160;</a>
extractor querying at a rate <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img24.gif"> retrieves more
than one information item, the rate is too slow.  If no new information
items are retrieved, the rate is too fast.  Since we assume that the
extractor has no control or knowledge <a name="635">&#160;</a>
about the update rate at the
remote server site, the extractor system adjusts <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img25.gif"> using an
algorithm <a name="636">&#160;</a>
which predicts the value of <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img27.gif"> at each moment in
time.  Our approach to making this prediction uses the previous
<img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img28.gif"> values measured by the extractor each time it queries the
remote server.  We initially define <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img29.gif"> to be:
<p>
<p><a name="eqquery1">&#160;</a><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img30.gif"><p>
<a name="642">&#160;</a>
<p>
where <b>I</b> <a name="643">&#160;</a> 
is the number of messages returned per query times the time 
interval between queries; <b>I</b> has units of messages per query times 
unit time.
<p>
Using this history<a name="644">&#160;</a> 
information a future value of <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img32.gif"> can be predicted
and a new <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205632im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img33.gif"> can be calculated.
<p>
Thus far, our analysis assumes that no errors or network failures 
<a name="645">&#160;</a><a name="646">&#160;</a><a name="647">&#160;</a> can
occur, an assumption that is, of course, completely unrealistic.
Network failures cannot be ignored; we are therefore
obliged to add recovery factors and robustness to the model for the
unfortunate case of network breakdowns.  Consider the space -
time diagram in figure <a href="node14.html#figts">2.1</a>.   The information sources are
grouped into one abstract entity on the right.  Time flows from the
bottom to the top, and events are shown as circles inscribed on the
entity lines at which they occur.  Source events<a name="649">&#160;</a> 
S1 and S2 travel to the database Server where the information items are 
immediately updated as indicated by update events U1 and U2.
