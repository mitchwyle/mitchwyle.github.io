<h1><a name="SECTION001040000000000000000"> The Future</a></h1>
<p>

<p>
The research carried out in this dissertation anticipates a time when
most information will be communicated to the workplace and the home by
digital means.  Digital delivery of information over large,
inter-connected networks will make a wider range of information sources
available to most individuals.  We hope that the software approach
presented here will help form the basis to filter and process the large
volume of information that will be received.
<p>
Our approach to filtering the exponentially growing information base
within the Matrix is that of an automatic SDI subscription service.
The service gathers information from several sources, <em> copying</em> the
information in order to store and analyse it locally; then it delivers
certain messages to subscribers.  The approach used by most other
Matrix IR systems including most of the systems reviewed in 
section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014211156/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node9.html#secaim">1.3</a> is that of a passive database or IR system that waits for
subscriber queries.  In the polychannel model, there is no provision
for modern IR techniques, and ``filtering'' is a matter of simple
Boolean matching.
<p>
If we were to pick and choose the strongest features of all existing
models that are designed to operate in the Matrix (including Pasadena)
in order to integrate them into a new system which might be better than
any of the existing ones, the following list of features would be
adopted:
<p>
<ul><li> The Z39.50 library document interchange protocol from WAIS,
  <li> The ``dynamic folder'' user interface and agent,
        paradigm proposed in the WAIS design but never implemented,
  <li> The Xanadu (or other similar) file system,
  <li> The Xanadu (or other similar) document browsing system,
  <li> The Polychannel simplex (broadcast medium) multicast protocol
        for distributing the announcement of new Matrix information
        resources and certain messages
  <li> The Pasadena filtering stage model and ranking algorithms
</ul>
<p>
Although the Z39.50 protocol has not yet been standardized,
implementations of the draft standard in WAIS and other commercial
systems have already become popular; furthermore, experience gathered
by using systems that incorporate Z39.50 indicates that it is
flexible enough to support sophisticated information retrieval
applications within the extensive information space of the expanding
Matrix.
<p>
We also find the dynamic folder concept very appealing because of the
familiarity we gained with software agent notions in developing
Pasadena's selective information extraction system.  The Pasadena
system aperiodically queries remote passive sources based only on
modelling information flow; the dynamic folders concept (in addition to
other software agent proposals) provides a richer set of parameters for
signalling and controlling the query of remote sources.
<p>
The Xanadu file system is designed to solve many of the same underlying
problems addressed by full-blown relational database management systems
(DBMS), namely fast access to diverse units of information containing
<em> links</em> to other such units.  If we had had some of the features in
the Xanadu file system during the development of Pasadena, many of the
software engineering problems would have been solved more efficiently.
It is safe to assume that the future of file systems includes many DBMS
features as well as automatic inverted file indexing.
<p>
The use of broadcast communication in the polychannel model dovetails
wonderfully into the SDI concept, effectively solving the distribution
problem.  As we indicated in section<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014211156/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node9.html#secaim">1.3</a>, the major defects
of the WAIS system are its lack of facilities for new resource
discovery and no real SDI facility.  Using broadcast media such as
radio or broadband communication networks (cable TV), the computer
systems used by subscribers could automatically receive digital
``advertisements'' of new information resources, and capture the
descriptions and Z39.50 query information for sources that might be of
interest to the subscriber.  In other words, the resource discovery
filtering stage from the Pasadena system could run locally on each
subscriber's machine.
<p>
The use of a broadcast communications medium in conjunction with the
sophisticated dynamic folders (or other software agent system) breaks
down the final barrier standing in the way of eliminating the need for
a <em> centralized</em> SDI service along with the costly and inefficient
message <em> cache</em> associated with such a service.  The Z39.50
protocol allows for the effective distribution of IR ranking algorithms
between a subscriber's local system and all of the remote information
sources it queries.  As is the case in the current version of the WAIS
system, document surrogates (feature statistics) are sent to the
subscriber's system from each remote server where the ranking algorithm
integrates the data and calculates RSVs.  The dynamic folders system
could take the place of Pasadena's subscriber profile model and be stored
directly on the subscriber's system.
<p>
One final possible future enhancement to agent software in the Matrix
is a safe and useful implementation of self-reproducing programs.
There may come a time when software agents routinely create small,
time-limited search programs, which run on separate machines throughout
the matrix, searching for information and cooperatively communicating
with other agents.  In fact, before the turn of the century, these or
other software agents may account for the use of most computing
resources.
