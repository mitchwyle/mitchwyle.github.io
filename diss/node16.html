<p>
IR research has an unfortunate lack of simple techniques which take
into account the coarse structure<a name="1244">&#160;</a> 
of messages in indexing and retrieval
methods.  Full-blown natural language processing (NLP)<a name="1245">&#160;</a> is 
complex, <a name="1246">&#160;</a><a name="1247">&#160;</a>
difficult, and computationally expensive [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Maul91">Maul91</a>].  It can also
unfortunately yield poor retrieval results.  We therefore explore
the use of statistical text analysis using <em> paragraph structure</em>.
<a name="1250">&#160;</a>
<p>
Text, by definition, is composed of strings of letters, delimiters, and
punctuation<a name="1251">&#160;</a>.<a name="1252">&#160;</a>
Practically all messages, in any collection, contain
additional <em> structure</em> of varying degree.  The text contained in
any message adheres to the grammatical and linguistical rules of the
language in which it is written.  Additionally, the distinct sentences
in a text separate the ideas it contains.  Paragraphs, <a name="1254">&#160;</a>
sections, and
chapters add further hierarchical structure.  Even the positions of
words, phrases, and sentences in a paragraph or in a section are
significant factors in the semantic meaning <a name="1255">&#160;</a>
of the text.  As noted<a name="1256">&#160;</a>
earlier, we preclude the use of NLP parsing <a name="1257">&#160;</a>
for feature weighting based
on message structure.  Instead, we concentrate on a simpler, more rigid
structure inherent in the WAN <a name="1258">&#160;</a> messages themselves.
<p>
In these collections, certain paragraphs are designed to be
semantically dense indices into the full-text of the message.  These
paragraphs are usually displayed to the reader <em> before</em> the
full-text of a message.  In fact, WAN message readers will often base
their decision of whether to read or reject a message on these
content-identifier paragraphs.  Such paragraphs are called <em> message
headers</em>.  These <a name="1261">&#160;</a> <a name="1262">&#160;</a>
headers include subject, author, keywords, summary,
references, and other formally defined fields [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Hort87">Hort87</a>].  Most WAN
message authors, because of the limited size and large importance of
these fields, will exert a significant effort in trying to express the
meaning <a name="1264">&#160;</a> 
of their entire message in the small space afforded in these
fields.  It is then logical to hypothesize that giving the indexing
features found in these paragraphs more weight in indexing and retrieval
algorithms will give such algorithms significantly better retrieval
performance than algorithms that weight such features the same as those
found in the full-text paragraphs.  We would therefore like to weight
the component features of such paragraphs <em> differently</em> from the
full-text of the rest of the message.
<p>
One paragraph weighting scheme proposed recently is due to Salton and
Buckley [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt90">Salt90</a>] [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt91">Salt91</a>].  They proposed a scheme for short
text <a name="1268">&#160;</a><a name="1269">&#160;</a>
excerpts <a name="1270">&#160;</a> <a name="1271">&#160;</a><a name="1272">&#160;</a>
including <a name="1273">&#160;</a><a name="1274">&#160;</a>
sentences and paragraphs for use in the
searching system of a large, <a name="1275">&#160;</a>
on-line <a name="1276">&#160;</a>
static encyclopedia.  They noted
that text similarity measures which depend on the proportion of
matching features are not always indicative of coincidence in text
meaning<a name="1277">&#160;</a>.<a name="1278">&#160;</a>
<a name="1279">&#160;</a>
For <a name="1280">&#160;</a><a name="1281">&#160;</a>
example, fragments such as ``consider figure x'' or
``equation y is an example of'' may be repeated many times in ordinary
texts, but the vocabulary coincidences in such fragments are not
meaningful.  They therefore defined feature weights <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img86.gif"> for
feature <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img87.gif"> in <a name="1283">&#160;</a><a name="1284">&#160;</a>
an excerpt (sentence or paragraph) <b>p</b> as:
<p>
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img88.gif"><p>
<p>
<a name="1525">&#160;</a>
<p>
where <b>N</b> is the number of excerpts in the collection, and <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img90.gif"> 
is <a name="1291">&#160;</a><a name="1292">&#160;</a>
the maximum feature frequency of feature <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img91.gif"> in all
excerpts.  They explored slight variations of this weighting scheme and
settled
upon <a name="1293">&#160;</a>
using ``an enhanced term frequency 
measure'' [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt90">Salt90</a>] <a name="1295">&#160;</a>
which <a name="1296">&#160;</a>
yields a feature weight:
<p>
<p><a name="eqwts2">&#160;</a><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img92.gif"><p>
<p>
The similarity between excerpts 
is <a name="1312">&#160;</a><a name="1313">&#160;</a>
simply the vector product of their
vector space representations (<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img93.gif">) or the minimal 
overlap (<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img94.gif">), using <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img95.gif"> as defined above for 
feature weighting.
<p>

<p>
They <a name="1321">&#160;</a><a name="1322">&#160;</a>
used this excerpt similarity scheme for four purposes: first,
individual paragraphs of messages were retrieved based on their
similarity to other paragraphs; secondly, messages were clustered
according <a name="1323">&#160;</a>
to their ``global'' similarity <a name="1324">&#160;</a>
and <a name="1325">&#160;</a> the similarity of their
component excerpts; third, hypertext <a name="1326">&#160;</a><a name="1327">&#160;</a>
links were formed based on the
clustering criteria; and finally, a new RSV function was defined:
<p>
<p><a name="rsvsal">&#160;</a><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img96.gif"><p>
<a name="1530">&#160;</a>
<p>
where 
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img98.gif"><p>
<p>
<a name="1349">&#160;</a>
<a name="1350">&#160;</a>
<p>
<img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img101.gif"> is an empirically determined threshold<a name="1351">&#160;</a>, 
and the feature
weights <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img102.gif"> (see equation <a href="node16.html#eqwts2">2.12</a> above) are
used for the features in the excerpts.  They did not discern
different excerpt <em> types</em>, and therefore did not weight the
different paragraph types differently.  In the WAN message experiment
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt91">Salt91</a>], two paragraph types (message headers) were identified
but only <em> exact</em> matches in the paragraphs were used in the
retrieval method.
<p>
In an effort to give the indexing features found in the special WAN
paragraphs more importance, we define a new feature weighting component
to be used by WAN message indexing algorithms that accounts for the
source paragraph<a name="1357">&#160;</a> type<a name="1358">&#160;</a> 
in which the feature is found.  Let <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img103.gif"> be<a name="1359">&#160;</a>
a set of paragraph types and <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img105.gif"> <a name="1361">&#160;</a>
denote a paragraph of <a name="1531">&#160;</a>
type <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img108.gif"> (<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img109.gif">).  Further, let us refine our definition of
a WAN message <b>d</b> to consist of a set<a name="1363">&#160;</a> 
of paragraphs: 
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img110.gif">, where each
paragraph <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img111.gif"> consists of a set of features from a given
vocabulary <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img112.gif">:
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img113.gif">.
<p>
For our purpose, we define these paragraph types to be the WAN 
message<a name="1372">&#160;</a><a name="1373">&#160;</a>
header<a name="1374">&#160;</a> 
fields<a name="1375">&#160;</a><a name="1376">&#160;</a>
or a full-text paragraph within a message.  Additionally,
the <em> first</em> paragraph<a name="1378">&#160;</a> 
of the full text is considered as a
separate paragraph type.  Specifically, <p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img114.gif"><p>
<p>
The <em> feature density</em> <a name="1380">&#160;</a><a name="1381">&#160;</a>
or <a name="1382">&#160;</a><a name="1383">&#160;</a>
compression ratio of a given paragraph
type can be expressed as <a name="1384">&#160;</a><a name="1385">&#160;</a>
the normalized ratio of the average size of the<a name="1386">&#160;</a>
paragraph<a name="1387">&#160;</a> 
type to the average<a name="1388">&#160;</a> 
size of the entire message, where these
sizes are measured<a name="1389">&#160;</a> <a name="1390">&#160;</a>
in the number of indexing features that occur.
<p>
Because paragraph <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img115.gif"> does not necessarily appear in every 
message of a given message collection, we define the average size 
in features of paragraph type <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img116.gif"> in collection <b>D</b> to be:
<p>
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img117.gif"><p> 
where
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img118.gif"><p> 
<a name="1539">&#160;</a>
<p>
We must, of course, restrict<a name="1403">&#160;</a>
our analysis to those paragraph types that
appear in at least one document in the collection.
<p>
The average size in features of a message <b>d</b> in collection <b>D</b> is
simply:
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img120.gif"><p>
<a name="1540">&#160;</a>
<p>
The feature<a name="1407">&#160;</a><a name="1408">&#160;</a>
density for a given paragraph type <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img122.gif"> in a collection <b>D</b>
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img123.gif">, then, is
<a name="1409">&#160;</a>
<p>
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img125.gif"><p>
<p>
The feature density of a given paragraph type is small for paragraph types
containing few features and larger for paragraph types containing many
features.  In the case of paragraph types which are designed to 
summarize<a name="1412">&#160;</a><a name="1413">&#160;</a>
the entire meaning of a message,<a name="1414">&#160;</a>
the <a name="1415">&#160;</a>
paragraph density is inversely
proportional to the density<a name="1416">&#160;</a> 
of the summary<a name="1417">&#160;</a>.  That is, a short paragraph is a
denser summary than a long one.  Therefore, to assign higher weights to
shorter paragraphs with fewer but (assumed) more significant indexing
features, we invert <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img126.gif"> producing an inverse feature density,
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img127.gif">.
<p>
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img128.gif"><p>
<a name="1420">&#160;</a>
<p>
It is interesting to note, that the inverse feature densities of the
most significant WAN message paragraph types have an exponential
distribution.  We measured the inverse feature densities of the five
most important and frequently occurring summarizing WAN message
paragraph types.  When sorted in decreasing order, the distribution of
these values is an exponential decline.
<p>
<p><a name="2632">&#160;</a><a name="ipdplot">&#160;</a><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img129.gif">
<br><strong>Figure 2.3:</strong> Inverse Feature Densities of WAN Message Paragraphs<br>
<p>
<p>
The data displayed in figure <a href="node16.html#ipdplot">2.3</a> are plotted using a
semi-log scale.  The Y-axis is the <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img130.gif"> of each paragraph's
inverse feature density.  The paragraph types are displayed in
descending <b>ifd</b> value.  The reason for distinguishing the <em> first</em>
paragraph of a message as being different from the full-text is that it
is often the ``topical'' paragraph containing more densely summarized
information and therefore more important features.
<p>
In order to transform the <b>ifd</b> values into a linear distribution for more
effective term weighting, we use a
logarithm function to obtain the normalized inverse feature density
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img131.gif">.  For a given paragraph type <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img132.gif">, <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img133.gif"> is

<p>
This derived feature of a WAN message paragraph type can be used as an
approximation of the paragraph type's semantic<a name="2645">&#160;</a> 
density<a name="2646">&#160;</a>.  It can then be
incorporated in the baseline feature weighting functions in a number of
ways.  Experience using static WAN message collections indicates that a good
way of using these values is by replacing the message feature frequencies
(<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img135.gif">) by a sum of the message's component paragraph frequencies
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img136.gif"> and multiplying each <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205745im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img137.gif"> by the

These new feature weighting functions can be applied in an indexing and
retrieval method to improve retrieval performance (see chapter 4).

In this section, we proposed a new feature weighting function based on
the notion of giving more emphasis to the features appearing in certain

of several algorithms performs better in an empirical environment and
also for the theoretical filtering stages within a WAN information
server system.
