<blockquote> <em> By eliminating time and space as barriers, the very
achievements that put us within reach of a truly global economy are
burying us in irrelevant and useless data, in mountains of low-quality
ore that must be laboriously refined for relevant information, the
signal hidden in the noise.  The critical resource for turning this raw
data into useful information is computer software, as strategic a
resource in the information age as petroleum is today. -- B. Cox, <em>

<p>
We cannot give a comprehensive overview of IR<a name="318">&#160;</a> in this thesis;
the reader is instead referred to some standard texts [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt83">Salt83</a>]
<a name="320">&#160;</a> and [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Rijs79">Rijs79</a>] <a name="322">&#160;</a> as well
as a newer and more formal dense tutorial of IR concepts
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Scha92">Scha92</a>]<a name="324">&#160;</a>.
<p>
Information retrieval<a name="325">&#160;</a><a name="326">&#160;</a> systems<a name="327">&#160;</a> exist to
satisfy the information<a name="328">&#160;</a> needs of their users.
Although some newer browsing<a name="329">&#160;</a> methods [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Lesk91">Lesk91</a>]
allow for searching without a query, traditional IR always assumes that
the information need of the user is modeled as a query<a name="331">&#160;</a>
text.  The well-known distinction between
user-relevance<a name="332">&#160;</a> and
<a name="333">&#160;</a>query-relevance, i.e.  the difference between
how well a document satisfies the information need of the user versus
how well it matches a query, is one of the fundamental concerns both in
formulating definitions of relevance<a name="334">&#160;</a> and
also in new proposals for measuring retrieval
performance<a name="335">&#160;</a> (see section 2.4).  The
important distinction between queries in standard<a name="336">&#160;</a> 
test<a name="337">&#160;</a> collections whose supposed
absolute<a name="338">&#160;</a>, universal<a name="339">&#160;</a> <a name="340">&#160;</a><a name="341">&#160;</a>
relevance is determined by a <em> committee</em>, and queries whose
relevance is expressed by an <em> individual</em> is discussed only
informally, even in some modern studies of relevance [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Lose91">Lose91</a>].
Additionally, the obvious
time-dependence<a name="345">&#160;</a><a name="346">&#160;</a>
of an individual's information need, though mentioned occasionally
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Swan88">Swan88</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Clev91">Clev91</a>], has never been modeled or directly taken
into account.  In an interactive system, it is plausible that two
individual documents which are quite low on a user's ranked preference
list, suddenly shoot up the list when retrieved and viewed together.
Preferences among a retrieval set of documents can therefore change
suddenly during a single interactive session; individual, absolute
relevance assessments are therefore an inadequate model for
user<a name="349">&#160;</a><a name="350">&#160;</a><a name="351">&#160;</a><a name="352">&#160;</a>
relevance judgements.  User-preferences are probably better.  In a
subscription service, changes in relevance over longer time intervals
are the result of many factors, not just the effects of viewing
documents from the service.
<p>
The field of IR has boiled down to the mechanics of finding messages
that are most <em> similar<a name="353">&#160;</a></em> to a query text.  The
similarity<a name="354">&#160;</a> in meaning<a name="355">&#160;</a> of two texts is
sometimes called <em> homeosemy<a name="356">&#160;</a></em> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Karl77">Karl77</a>].  This
similarity is important not only for retrieving documents relevant to a
query, but also for clustering<a name="358">&#160;</a> similar documents
together for storage and also for building
information<a name="359">&#160;</a> structures to
categorize<a name="360">&#160;</a> the messages.  These structures can often
assist in the browsing and retrieval processes of large 
collections<a name="361">&#160;</a>
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt91">Salt91</a>].
<p>
In the next chapter we shall offer different and, we hope, slightly
better alternatives to some common IR assumptions; but let us first
consider the normal IR paradigms<a name="363">&#160;</a> and the body of
knowledge gleaned through the last four decades of scientific
investigations into text<a name="364">&#160;</a> analysis and
retrieval<a name="365">&#160;</a>.  Perhaps the most important common
result from the large number of text retrieval studies through the
years is that a detailed and complex semantic<a name="366">&#160;</a>
analysis of all messages in a collection is often not practical,
necessary, or even effective in approximating homeosemy for the purpose
of deriving good retrieval performance results.  Instead, the best
results for very large collections are obtained by systems which rely
upon the statistics<a name="367">&#160;</a> of term
occurrences<a name="368">&#160;</a> <a name="369">&#160;</a> in texts to
approximate similarities.  This statistical approximation of homeosemy
is not only computationally very practical, but also yields
surprisingly good retrieval performance when compared to many methods
of manual indexing<a name="370">&#160;</a>.  We therefore build upon
these practical and effective methods, instead of proposing yet another
radical new model for IR.
<p>
In addition to <em> relevance<a name="371">&#160;</a> feedback</em> and
other traditional methods<a name="372">&#160;</a> of
improving<a name="373">&#160;</a> a query text, we shall also explore
aspects of a user's information<a name="374">&#160;</a> need that are
not encoded in a query text.  These aspects include time-dependence,
new resource discovery<a name="375">&#160;</a><a name="376">&#160;</a>, 
retrieval set size, and very specific sets of
messages to be included or eliminated from a retrieval set, independent
of the ranking of the messages.  This exploration takes us into a
further discussion of new definitions of 
relevance<a name="377">&#160;</a> and effectiveness,
as well as an analysis and clarification of communication and
``information need.''<a name="378">&#160;</a><a name="379">&#160;</a>
<p>
There is some indication that methods for <a name="380">&#160;</a>
natural language processing<a name="381">&#160;</a>
have finally matured to the point that they can be used effectively for
retrieval and filtering [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Ande92">Ande92</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Hays91">Hays91</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Rau91">Rau91</a>],
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Jaco92">Jaco92</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Jac92a">Jac92a</a>].  However, other recent studies still
point out the extreme rigidity and major shortcomings inherent in these
models [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Maul91">Maul91</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205406/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt91">Salt91</a>].  Although our methods do
incorporate some simple semantic<a name="389">&#160;</a>
components such as stop-lists, word
reduction, and phrases, we do not pursue advanced natural language
parsing<a name="390">&#160;</a> (NLP) methods in this work.
