As indicated above, a user of the Matrix subscribes to the Pasadena
system through a four-step process.  A subscriber profile is created in the
database when a Matrix user issues a valid registration command.  The
main subscriber profile entry is created void of queries, and with only
those global default parameters are set which are required in the
registration message.  At this point in the profile's life cycle, no
actions are taken by the Pasadena system because no queries exist for
the profile.  When a subscriber creates at least one query in his
profile, the system begins searching for, processing, and sending
messages (along with feedback forms).  The design of many features
in the Pasadena system such as the ``prod'' interval (reminder
variable) is to allow for frequent changes in each query, so that
performance is enhanced and interest drift is tracked.  Sending
commands via electronic mail is usually not as ``comfortable'' as using an
interactive system.  For this reason an interactive profile editor was
developed (see below).  The <em> active</em> stage of a subscriber's
profile life cycle involves the creation, deletion and frequent update
of queries and their associated parameters.  It is also the intention
of the Pasadena system that as subscribers become more advanced, more,
different, high-performance commands will be used.  If for any reason a
subscriber wishes to discontinue using the service, the subscriber can
issue a ``sign-off'' command.  All profile data as well as query
indexes and other auxiliary data are then deleted from the Pasadena
system.
<p>
Pasadena maintains an exhaustive list of email addresses of every 
entity that has ever contacted the system.  Some of these addresses are
moved to a list of addresses known to cause endless mailer loops, and
others become active subscribers.  The system also has the capability of
storing all in-coming and out-going email messages for auditing.  
This feature
can be used to verify results of experiments run by the system.
<p>
The Pasadena system maintains user profile data as a collection of
small, relational databases.  Each registered subscriber has a global
profile containing a sequence of name - value pair parameters.
These global parameters are:
<ul><li> the subscriber's email address,
<li> the subscriber's name,
<li> the subscriber's telephone number,
<li> the subscriber's profession,
<li> the default number of messages the subscriber wishes to receive 
      after each query interval for each query, and
<li> the default number of virtual<a name="tex2html916" href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210351/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/footnode.html#6732"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="gif" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210351im_/http://vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/images/foot_motif.gif"></a>
	days the system should wait before 
      sending this subscriber a new set of messages.
</ul>
<p>
Each <em> query</em> in a subscriber's profile has a name and several
optional parameters:
<p>
The specific <b> query interval</b> specifies how many virtual days the
system should wait after sending a retrieved set of messages before
re-running the query.  A global
system parameter determines its range which in the current
implementation is between one and ten.  This parameter has a subtle but
important effect on the retrieval performance of a query.  The longer
the interval, the larger the dynamic message collection used for
retrieval.  If many new items arrive at the server every day, then making
the interval too long would lower performance because certain preferable
items would arrive too late to be ranked higher than other information.  If
very few new, preferable items arrive at the server every day, an
interval that is too short will retrieve many items that the subscriber
would prefer not to see for each relevant message; retrieval
performance would therefore suffer.  This interval defaults to the value
in the global part of the subscriber's profile.
<p>
The <b> retrieval set size</b> determines the total number of items that
should be sent to the subscriber from the vector space ranking
algorithms.   It does not have any effect on the number of items that
are sent as a result of a match by the include filter.  The range of
this parameter is also determined in the global system parameter file;
currently it ranges between two and thirty-two.  Obviously,
precision-oriented subscribers will choose a small retrieval set size,
and recall-oriented subscriber will choose a larger number.  This
parameter affects other aspects of the system, however.  The larger the
number, the more fields will appear on the feedback forms.  If
the forms have the subscriber rank only the relative usefulness of the
retrieved items among the retrieved set (as is the case in the current
implementation), then when there is a large number of messages, the
subscriber will be tasked with assigning many ranks.  Such a situation
is not always desirable, even though ties (messages with the same rank)
are allowed.  Again, the default for this parameter is the value
specified in the global part of the subscriber's profile.
<p>
For each query, a table of <b> database categories</b> contains
information indicating one of three states: subscription to a database
(i.e. the database should be scanned for this query), non-subscription
which means the database should not be scanned for this query, and a
third state which indicates either that the group is no longer
available, or that the subscriber has not yet decided if the query
should subscribe or not.  If a subscriber does not specify any
information, the query will be subscribed to all possible databases by
default.  A master table of all known databases is maintained
separately from those in the queries.  All query tables are updated
when the master table changes.  Each subscriber's resource discovery
filter is run when new databases and their descriptions enter the
master table of all remote sources.
<p>
Each query also has a <b> query text</b> which is treated similarly to
messages, except that these query texts contain no messages headers
(formatted fields).  Query texts contain the full-text of a
subscriber's query which should be expanded by the subscriber over time
to include paragraphs from relevant messages.  There is no default
value for the query text as it must accompany the query creation 
command.  Query creation commands with a blank query text are ignored.
<p>
Queries may also contain <b> inclusion</b> and <b> exclusion</b> filters.
These specifications contain the original (un-compiled) regular
expressions specified by the subscriber.  Pasadena's extended regular
expression pattern matching specification is described below in section
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210351/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node30.html#regeximp">4.4.3</a>.  Subscribers can anchor these filter specifications to
message header lines by including the header name in the expression.
By default neither of these patterns is active.
<p>
A query also contains a parameter called <b> reminder</b>.  The Pasadena
system contains the assumption that the interests of a user will drift
over time; it therefore automatically prods its subscribers to change
their queries after a default number of days or in the case that the
retrieval performance of a query is consistently very low.  This
positive integer parameter called ``reminder'' specifies the interval
between these prompts.  The system also tracks the last time such a
prod was sent to the subscriber reminding the subscriber to change the
query.  The default value of this parameter is stored in the system's
global parameter file and is currently thirty virtual days.
<p>
A list of message <b> header fields</b> is another optional
parameter for each query.  This parameter, if set, specifies the
exhaustive list of header fields from retrieved source messages that
should be included when the message is delivered, and also the <em>
order</em> in which they should appear.  If this parameter is not present,
all header lines from each message are sent with the message, in the
original order in which they appear in the message.  Setting this
parameter to null indicates that no header fields are desired.
<p>
Queries also contain certain system information over which the
subscriber has no control or knowledge.  For example, outstanding <b>
feedback form numbers</b> are kept in the query parameter database.  These
values are used by the Pasadena main daemon program (see below) to 
track which
experiment numbers belong to which queries.  When filled-out feedback
forms arrive back in the system, it uses these fields to process the
filled-out forms.
<p>
In this section, we presented some of the detailed requirements and
general design considerations of creating, updating, and deleting
subscriber profiles within the network-based subscription service
Pasadena.  The subscriber profile database design was discussed in some
detail.  We now present some aspects of the implementation of 
the Pasadena system.
