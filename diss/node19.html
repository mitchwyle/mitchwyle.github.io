We have seen in section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205936/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node12.html#overload">1.6</a> that WAN information has become
too voluminous to sift manually.  Based on the framework and recent

software agent</em><a name="3668">&#160;</a><a name="3669">&#160;</a>
ideas of Alan Kay [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205936/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Kahl91">Kahl91</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205936/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Kay91">Kay91</a>] we
present a new model which assumes a <em> passive</em> subscriber, and a
sophisticated, <em> active</em> software system [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205936/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyle89">Wyle89</a>]. In the
paradigm of the passive subscriber-model, a centralized service performs
routine<a name="3675">&#160;</a>, 
algorithmic<a name="3676">&#160;</a> 
information<a name="3677">&#160;</a> gathering, 
filtering <a name="3678">&#160;</a> and transmission<a name="3679">&#160;</a>
tasks.  In contrast to the traditional (active) user model 
of <a name="3680">&#160;</a> existing
software systems, the passive subscriber model posits a semi-interactive
system acting as an intermediary for the user.  Semi-interactive in
this case means that a user specifies actions for a system to perform
periodically or based on asynchronous<a name="3681">&#160;</a> events. 
The model<a name="3682">&#160;</a> minimizes
direct user-manipulation<a name="3683">&#160;</a>.  
It offers the following advantages to the
traditional SDI paradigm and other systems:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
  <li> <b> autonomy</b>:  <a name="3686">&#160;</a>
  Existing clipping<a name="3687">&#160;</a><a name="3688">&#160;</a>
  services<a name="tex2html687" href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205936/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/footnode.html#3689"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="gif" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205936im_/http://vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/images/foot_motif.gif"></a> and most
    existing SDI systems require some human<a name="3690">&#160;</a> 
    intermediary<a name="3691">&#160;</a> action 
    and assistance; our model proposes somewhat more 
    independence on the part of the system, especially for new 
    resource discovery and integration.
  <li> <b> time dependencies of information need</b>:  The passive 
      subscriber model
      assumes a <em> drift</em> <a name="3694">&#160;</a><a name="3695">&#160;</a>
      in user-interest and automatically prods<a name="3696">&#160;</a>
      a user to make profile<a name="3697">&#160;</a> 
      changes<a name="3698">&#160;</a>.
  <li> <b> integration of new information sources</b>:  A 
  subscriber's<a name="3700">&#160;</a><a name="3701">&#160;</a>
      profile is automatically matched against new sources as
      they become available<a name="3702">&#160;</a>.
  <li> <b> use of modern IR algorithms</b>:  Through the use of 
  <em> dynamic</em> <a name="3705">&#160;</a>
  <a name="3706">&#160;</a><a name="3707">&#160;</a>
  message collections (described below), the passive 
  user model allows for the application of modern IR methods which 
  employ statistical<a name="3708">&#160;</a> 
  text analysis in their homeosemy<a name="3709">&#160;</a> calculations.
  Traditional SDI<a name="3710">&#160;</a> 
  models decide whether to send a new information item
  based solely on the individual item and a
  stored Boolean<a name="3711">&#160;</a> query<a name="3712">&#160;</a> 
  in subscriber profiles.
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, this model takes advantage of existing communications
channels<a name="3714">&#160;</a><a name="3715">&#160;</a> 
that subscribers already understand and use daily.  For
example, electronic<a name="3716">&#160;</a> 
mail<a name="3717">&#160;</a> (email) and 
client<a name="3718">&#160;</a> - server network 
software<a name="3719">&#160;</a><a name="3720">&#160;</a>
<a name="3721">&#160;</a>
could be used as the communications medium<a name="3722">&#160;</a>.  
The subscriber would then
receive information items via his or her electronic mail 
user<a name="3723">&#160;</a> agent<a name="3724">&#160;</a>
(UA)<a name="3725">&#160;</a> program and would therefore not have to learn to use a new
program or user-interface in order to use a system employing this
model.  Profile editing can be accommodated by a kind of ``forms
processing'' paradigm (see below) or a user-friendlier interactive
system.  In either case, the emphasis is on using existing, consistent
methods of interaction to communicate with the user.
<p>
Another new aspect of the passive subscriber model is a method of user
- computer interaction whereby each message the system sends to a
subscriber <a name="3726">&#160;</a><a name="3727">&#160;</a>
is actually a valid command which can be interpreted by the
system.  When the system sends information messages, they are
surrounded by ``comment'' commands which cause them to be ignored by
the system's command interpreter.  If <b>L</b> is the set of commands
accepted by an information server <b>IS</b>, then the passive subscriber
model restricts <b>M</b>, the set of all possible messages sent by the <b>IS</b>
to its subscribers to be a subset of <b>L</b>, <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205936im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img169.gif">.  When a
subscriber asks to see a portion or all of his profile, he or she
receives as output the system commands needed to create that portion or
the entire profile, respectively.  For large profiles, such messages
can contain several dozen system commands in a single message.  A
subscriber can therefore issue commands to the system by making slight
changes to the messages the system has sent.  This new type of dialog
includes fill-in-the-blank <em> forms processing</em> for certain functions
typical of interactive systems.  But more importantly, an <b>IS</b> can also
display comprehensive and detailed sets of 
examples<a name="3729">&#160;</a> in reply to help
requests, <a name="3730">&#160;</a>
expediting the use of complex or difficult system commands
via motivating, tutorial <em> palettes of examples</em>.  
However, since sending pure-text commands to
a software system may be incommodious, a user-friendly, 
interactive<a name="3732">&#160;</a>
component <a name="3733">&#160;</a>
for profile editing and update (see section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205936/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node27.html#implementation">4.4</a>) 
can be used to
generate the text for the user-dialog component of the passive
subscriber model.
<p>
A system based on the passive subscriber model (see 
figure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205936/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node20.html#figpassive">3.1</a>)
accepts commands from the user, creates and stores an interest
profile, and then periodically, supplies information to the user.
This periodic delivery is automatic; there is no human intermediary.
The user <em> passively</em> receives information from the system, without
having to re-submit queries every so often.  The passive user model
accommodates an interest drift, and a system employing the model
automatically reminds its subscribers to update their profiles.
<p>
In this section, we introduced the passive subscriber model; this model
includes an interesting forms-processing paradigm and the 
concept of palettes of examples.  In the next section we describe the
individual stages of the filtering process.
