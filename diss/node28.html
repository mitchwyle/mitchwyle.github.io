<h2><a name="SECTION00941000000000000000"> Daemon Program</a></h2>
<a name="irintrf">&#160;</a>
<p>
The main program is a so-called <em> daemon</em> process which runs
constantly; it responds to many types of events and console commands
from the Pasadena administrator.  This main program coordinates,
schedules, and executes other processes.  It was first implemented
early in 1990 and later changed to incorporate interactive profile
editing and interactive database queries.  In the last few years, many
bugs were fixed and a few features were added such that the system can
now run for at least a few months without the need for operator
intervention.  The main Pasadena daemon program consists of three
high-level modules (see figure <a href="node28.html#modstruc">4.2</a>).  
The module <tt> procmail<a name="6763">&#160;</a></tt> executes user commands
which are sent to the system either in electronic mail messages or
through the interactive profile-editor.  It also sends error messages
and calls other subscriber profile processing routines.  The second module,
<tt> procnews<a name="6764">&#160;</a></tt> 
processes messages (news articles) which are in Usenet
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Hort87">Hort87</a>] format.  It maintains a database of indexed messages,
adding, creating, indexing, and deleting message indexes.  The third
module, <tt> irintrf</tt> provides an interface to the information
retrieval routines which are all run as separate processes.
<p>
These three modules are supported by a set of routines found in five
mid-level modules, called <tt> newsdist</tt>, <tt> ngmaint</tt>, <tt> filter</tt>,
<tt> profman</tt>, and <tt> utility</tt>.  A larger set of core modules
contains low-level routines which are not specific to Pasadena.  These
routines are used by most of the higher-level modules and include the
following:  <tt> misc</tt>, <tt> unique</tt>, <tt> handlers</tt>, <tt> scandir</tt>,
<tt> match</tt>, <tt> profile</tt>, <tt> formgen</tt>, <tt> console</tt>.
<p>
<p><a name="6975">&#160;</a><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img360.gif">
<br><strong>Figure 4.2:</strong> Pasadena main daemon program: Module Structure &amp; 
Interfaces <a name="modstruc">&#160;</a><br>
<p>
<p>
The module <tt> handlers</tt> provides for sophisticated error handling
capabilities including several levels of error severity and different
methods of recovery and exception handling.  Severity is defined
hierarchically; the data structures and algorithms are very similar to
those used by the programming language LISP [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wins84">Wins84</a>].  Critical
sections of a program are enclosed by <tt> catch_begin</tt> and <tt>
catch_end</tt>.  If an error occurs while inside such blocks, it is
signalled by the function <tt> throw</tt>.  The error handler unwinds the
stack until a matching <tt> catch</tt> is found.  A fatal error occurs if
no matching <tt> catch</tt> can be found.  The static variable <tt> caught</tt>
is cleared when a <tt> catch_begin</tt> is executed and set whenever <tt>
throw</tt> is called.  Most routines in the main Pasadena program signal
errors by calling one of <tt> fatal_error</tt>, <tt> error</tt>, or <tt>
warning</tt>.  These routines accept <tt> printf</tt><a name="tex2html921" href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/footnode.html#6976"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="gif" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504im_/http://vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/images/foot_motif.gif"></a> arguments.  <tt> fatal_error</tt> never returns; instead it
executes a <tt> throw(catch_fatal);</tt> which terminates the process.
Again adhering to the <em> de facto</em> standards of most C-language
run-time environments, the reason for an error can be obtained by
calling a function <tt> error_reason</tt>.  When running in production
mode, Pasadena traps most operating system signals and translates them
into calls to <tt> throw</tt>.  This trap and signal handling mechanism is
encoded within the <tt> handlers</tt> module.
<p>
The Pasadena system includes several other error detection and recovery
mechanims.  For example, the heuristic used to detect mailer loops is
as follows:  If it is determined that sending messages to a particular
email address causes a message to be generated for some large number of
repetitions during a short time interval, that address is ``suspected''
of generating a mailer loop.  The address is added to a ``suspected''
database and no messages are ever sent to that address until the
Pasadena administrator manually removes the address from the suspected
list or changes the subscriber's address.  If the messages returned
from that address happen to be valid Pasadena commands, the subscriber
is <em> not</em> added to the suspected list.  It is therefore
theoretically possible but very unlikely for this loop detection system
to fail if the system (or person) causing a mailer loop sends the
Pasadena system only valid Pasadena commands.  It is also possible but
again very unlikely to add a valid subscriber to the suspected list if
a large number of messages are exchanged during a short time interval
between the subscriber and the Pasadena system with no valid Pasadena
commands coming from the subscriber.
<p>
Another noteworthy aspect of the Pasadena system implementation is the
heavy use of <em> parameter</em> data stored in secondary medium (data
files).  The module <tt> profile</tt> contains a large number of small
functions to load, read, modify, and store collections of name - value
pairs from a startup file.  These routines are used not only by the
main Pasadena daemon program, but also by the interactive profile
editor, message retrieval browser, and certain IR components which
require static parameters.  This parameter handling implementation
allows for a limited amount of variable <em> scoping</em>; a variable can
be either local or global.  In the realization of the system, the first
group of name - value pairs is called the <em> global section</em> and is
used, for example, in the global section of subscribers' profiles.  The
other groups are called local sections.  These sections are used for
queries within a profile.  Data stored in a variable can be a string,
an integer, or a float.  The main Pasadena daemon program has a large
set of parameters that the system reads when it starts.  Almost all
aspects of the system can be changed by updating the system's parameter
file (stored as text).  No re-compilation is necessary.  When the
Pasadena system itself changes a parameter file, it uses a procedure to write
the data first to a temporary file; then it moves this temporary file
to the real parameter file name.  This method of first writing to a
temporary file, then using an atomic system call to create the
destination file is used often in Pasadena to protect the files from
partial changes caused by system crashes.
<p>
The passive user model (section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node19.html#passive">3.1</a>) includes a ``forms''
processing paradigm whereby the information server (<b>IS</b>) itself
generates partial or sometimes even complete <em> system commands</em>
which it sends to subscribers.  Subscribers then make changes to the
forms or fill them in when they are blank, and then send them back to
the <b>IS</b>.  <tt> formgen</tt> is the Pasadena system's forms processing
module that creates various forms for on-line help, feedback, database
category
maintenance, and for parsing command responses.  Form definitions are
stored in template files  in a library directory. The template forms
consist of a header, a repeating data part, and a form body.  The
repeated part is delimited by a special pattern.  The definition of the
data fields (typically only one line) contains a <tt> printf</tt> format
command that is replaced by the actual data when the form is sent out.
A sample form that the Pasadena system currently uses is
given here as an example (see figure <a href="node28.html#sf">4.3</a>).
<p><a name="6978">&#160;</a><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img361.gif">
<br><strong>Figure 4.3:</strong> Example <b> form</b> Template in the Pasadena System <a name="sf">&#160;</a><br>
<p>
<p>
The <tt> newsdist</tt> module in the main Pasadena daemon program is also
worthy of mention.  This module processes new messages as they become
available for distribution.  It runs the IR algorithms and prepares
algorithm performance data for the usefulness calculation.  It may be
considered the heart of the Pasadena program.  This module contains a
procedure that selects and distributes new messages for all queries in a
subscriber's profile.  When examining the subscriber's profile, this
module will skip the entire profile if the subscriber is unavailable
for some reason (i.e. if the <b> vacation</b> variable is set.  A
separate procedure receives a profile and a single query.  It first
checks the per-query suspension variable to see if the subscriber has
temporarily turned this query off.  If so, it returns.  Otherwise it
examines the query interval and the last time this query was executed.
If the query is not yet due to run, it returns.  If the query is due to
run, it first loads the query's filters (if any are present); then it
creates a dynamic message collection, starts the IR algorithms,
updates its databases and sends the messages and a feedback form to the
subscriber.
<p>
The dynamic message collection procedure within this module works
as follows.  First the procedure scans the message database
for messages that are younger than a certain number of days (the query
interval) and that are from database categories to which the query is
subscribed.  If an exclude filter is present, it is loaded and all
matching news items are filtered out.  If the exclude filter removes
all candidate messages, and the original number of candidate messages
is above a threshold, a warning is sent to the subscriber that his
exclude filter may be too broad.  The procedure calls each IR
algorithm's RSV (ranking) program to obtain a ranked list of retrieval
status values.
<p>
Another procedure examines the query-specific number of items to be
retrieved, and picks messages from the two algorithms' ranked lists
until this number is reached.  The selected messages are then
registered and counted; duplicates are eliminated by examining the list
of messages which are already chosen to be sent.  If there are
duplicates, the selection process continues until the desired number of
messages is reached.  After the selection, the messages are sent to the
subscriber.  If an include filter is active, the job file is scanned
for messages which have not yet been chosen by the retrieval algorithms
but which match the filter specification.  Such messages are also sent
to the subscriber, but they will not appear on the feedback form.  If
more than one news message is selected by the IR algorithms, a
so-called experiment dump file is created which contains the ranked
list of relevant messages which were selected by each algorithm.  Then
a feedback form is created and sent to the subscriber.  The procedure
that is used to send an individual WAN message to a subscriber also
performs some filtering operations.  It prefixes the message with
certain email header lines and filters out unwanted headers from the
message itself.  The implementation of the orthogonality restriction on
the message sets produced by the inclusion and exclusion filtering
stages discussed in section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node20.html#filter">3.2</a> is accomplished as follows.
Those messages matching the inclusion pattern are searched again for
the exclusion pattern.  Matches here generate a warning message to the
subscriber and messages matching both patterns are not sent.
<p>
The final major module within the main Pasadena daemon program we would
like to highlight in this discussion is the <tt> utility</tt> module which
processes returned feedback forms and computes the usefulness
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Frei91">Frei91</a>] measure.  The procedure that reads filled-out feedback
forms detects lines which appear to contain feedback information.  This
detection is accomplished by the same general-purpose regular
expression parsing mechanism used in include and exclude filtering.
The state information for the appropriate experiment, the so-called
``experiment dump'' whose number corresponds to the current feedback
form is then loaded and the ranks are determined.  The <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>
values are computed and written to a database A separate procedure
calculates the number of valid experiments <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img362.gif">, the number of
positive ranks <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img363.gif">, the value of <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img364.gif">, the variance <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img365.gif">, the

also calculates the error probability <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210504im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img368.gif">.
All of these values are displayed and written to a report file.
<p>
Our description of the system implementation thus far has covered only
the main daemon program which coordinates the other components of the
system.  We come now to the client - server software; these two
programs provide interactive access to Pasadena's momentary ``cache''
of WAN messages and a user-friendly interactive profile editor for
updating user profiles more comfortably than by issuing commands via
email.
