<blockquote> <em>...it is important for responsible scientists, academicians,
popularizers, and researchers to do all in their power to write articles and
present papers that have the power to compel the reader to move from reading
to doing.  -- C. Bernier &amp; A. Yerkey,
<em> Cogent Communication:  Overcoming Reading Information Overload</em> p. 207.
</blockquote>
<p>
Scientific and many other kinds of literature are usually not
considered for their persuasive<a name="398">&#160;</a> 
power; instead one views them as a
vehicle for the presentation of data in a rigid, unemotional format.
However, most scientists truly want to influence 
opinion<a name="399">&#160;</a> and action<a name="400">&#160;</a> by
their presentations; they would be disappointed if their work failed to
do so.  In fact, we would claim that any and all recorded information,
be it a short message or a textbook, is intended by the author to
elicit some action by the reader.  Action here can mean anything from a
small change in attitude to an immediate, physical reaction.  We
include the effectiveness of a message in eliciting an action by its
reader, or the <em> cogency</em> of that message as part of the reader's
preference judgement.  Instead of asking a reader to rank retrieved
messages according to their ``relevance to a current
information need,'' we also ask the reader to consider ``the
effectiveness of a message in eliciting an action.''
<p>
This quality<a name="402">&#160;</a> 
of message's relevance depends not only upon the message
itself, but also on the sender, the receiver, and the medium.  We shall
analyse each of these aspects in turn.
<p>
<b> the source<a name="403">&#160;</a></b>
<p>
It is well established that the receiver evaluates a message and the
source of the message at the same time [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Bern79">Bern79</a>],
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Schri89">Schri89</a>].  This interaction can serve either to increase the
message's persuasiveness or to decrease it.  The attitude of the
receiver toward the source is evaluated by the perceived <em>
credibility</em> and the perceived <em> identification</em>.  
Credibility<a name="408">&#160;</a>
includes expertness<a name="409">&#160;</a>, 
subject proficiency<a name="410">&#160;</a>, 
qualification<a name="411">&#160;</a>, competence<a name="412">&#160;</a>,
authoritativeness<a name="413">&#160;</a>, 
trustworthiness<a name="414">&#160;</a>, etc.  Aristotle<a name="415">&#160;</a> 
took a somewhat
broader view of credibility and included such factors as apparent
motive<a name="416">&#160;</a>, character<a name="417">&#160;</a>, fairness<a name="418">&#160;</a>, 
friendliness<a name="419">&#160;</a>, and good<a name="420">&#160;</a> sense.  
More recent
literature in rhetoric<a name="421">&#160;</a> 
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Gros90">Gros90</a>] reveals another dimension of
credibility called <em> dynamism<a name="423">&#160;</a></em>.  
Dynamism is the liveliness<a name="424">&#160;</a> or
forcefulness in persuasion<a name="425">&#160;</a>.  
Several methods of formalizing and
quantifying these factors have been presented in the 
cognitive<a name="426">&#160;</a>
psychology literature [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Podp89">Podp89</a>].  Since we feel that the only
useful assessments for cogency<a name="428">&#160;</a> 
are from the receiver, we account for
the message source only by the <em> receiver's</em> 
evaluation<a name="430">&#160;</a> of the
source.
<p>
<b> the message itself</b>
<p>
The main burden of eliciting action from a reader lies in the message
itself:  what is said, how it is stated and how the elements of the
message are arranged<a name="432">&#160;</a>.  
Although the source itself can be a means of
persuasion, electronic media can serve to minimize this effect
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Quar90">Quar90</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Hilt81">Hilt81</a>].  Because there are no physical cues
other than the text or other media of a message, it is easier to
concentrate on the topic<a name="435">&#160;</a> of 
discussion rather than the person behind
the message.
<p>
To be cogent, it is important that a message be relatively free of
noise, irrelevancies<a name="436">&#160;</a>, and 
<em> meanemes<a name="437">&#160;</a></em>.<a name="tex2html315" href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/footnode.html#578"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="gif" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443im_/http://vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/images/foot_motif.gif"></a> 
It has been shown repeatedly that the removal of meanemes not
only saves reading time, but can also improve the reader's
assimilation<a name="440">&#160;</a>, remembering<a name="441">&#160;</a>, 
learning<a name="442">&#160;</a>, and integration<a name="443">&#160;</a> 
of the information in the 
message [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Bern79">Bern79</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Hilt85">Hilt85</a>].  Bernier<a name="446">&#160;</a> and 
Yerkey<a name="447">&#160;</a>
recommend the dissemination of terse<a name="448">&#160;</a> 
conclusions and very dense<a name="449">&#160;</a>
summaries, while Hiltz<a name="450">&#160;</a> and Turoff<a name="451">&#160;</a>
prefer to limit the author<a name="452">&#160;</a> in the
length of individual messages to ensure that communicated
messages be concise<a name="453">&#160;</a>.  
Both sets of authors admit that some flexibility
is necessary in message length.  None of the authors recommends a
method for this flexibility.  We feel that length<a name="454">&#160;</a> 
limitations and
filtering should be exercised by the <em> reader;</em> as we shall see in
chapter 3, we have designed software models to facilitate the <em>
reader's</em> access to denser<a name="457">&#160;</a> 
paragraphs of a message (surrogates) and to
filter<a name="458">&#160;</a> out unwanted paragraphs.
<p>
There are other important factors in the message that affect its
cogency and therefore a reader's preferences concerning it.  A
message's composition<a name="459">&#160;</a> or
formulation<a name="460">&#160;</a> is significant.  This dimension includes
the methods and order of presentation<a name="461">&#160;</a>, the
expressiveness<a name="462">&#160;</a> of the arguments<a name="463">&#160;</a>,
and how well the message establishes the motivational<a name="464">&#160;</a>
goals and values [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Shar90">Shar90</a>].  Another prominent aspect of cogency and
relative relevance is
the message's <em> appeal<a name="466">&#160;</a></em>.  It can appeal to the reader
emotionally, logically<a name="467">&#160;</a>, or
syllogistically<a name="468">&#160;</a>.  Finally, there is the
inherent credibility<a name="469">&#160;</a> of the message itself.  We
believe that the receiver's evaluation of these factors is the most
important part of a the cogency aspect of a relevance measure.
<p>
<b> the receiver</b>
<p>
It is helpful both to a sender, and to the receiver himself to be
cognizant of the general factors inherent in a receiver which affect
message relevance.  The so-called <em> personal<a name="471">&#160;</a></em> 
characteristics of a
receiver<a name="472">&#160;</a>, 
such as self-image<a name="473">&#160;</a>, 
open-mindedness<a name="474">&#160;</a>, anxiety<a name="475">&#160;</a>, 
intelligence<a name="476">&#160;</a>,
as well as demographic<a name="477">&#160;</a> 
characteristics such as age<a name="478">&#160;</a> and gender<a name="479">&#160;</a> 
are extremely variable, impossible to control [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Bern79">Bern79</a>], and are not
pertinent to our purpose.  We concentrate on a more tangible and
measurable trait, namely the concept of <em> cognitive 
consistency<a name="481">&#160;</a></em> or
rational evaluation<a name="482">&#160;</a> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Tobi89">Tobi89</a>].
<p>
The receiver of a message maintains cognitive consistency during the
reception process by ``fitting<a name="484">&#160;</a>'' 
an incoming message into his existing
attitude-belief<a name="485">&#160;</a><a name="486">&#160;</a><a name="487">&#160;</a>
<a name="488">&#160;</a>
structure [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#McGr69">McGr69</a>].  The reception<a name="490">&#160;</a> process
includes automatic filtering steps that minimize 
incongruities<a name="491">&#160;</a> between
existing attitudes<a name="492">&#160;</a> and any 
new, plausible<a name="493">&#160;</a>, convincing messages.  When
inconsistencies arise, the receiver may reject, ignore, misinterpret,
distort, or change the message.  Or, he may change his existing
attitude to concur with the message.  Individuals avoid situations
which produce cognitive dissonance and inconsistencies, selectively
exposing themselves to persuasive<a name="494">&#160;</a>
appeals<a name="495">&#160;</a> with which they agree.
Persuasion usually requires several different messages over time to
change embedded attitudes<a name="496">&#160;</a>.  
When strong and repeated messages at odds
with a receiver's attitude persist, the receiver will go through stages
of acceptance<a name="497">&#160;</a>, 
starting with avoidance<a name="498">&#160;</a> and progressing through phases
of rationalization<a name="499">&#160;</a>, distortion<a name="500">&#160;</a>, 
and attitude differentiation<a name="501">&#160;</a>
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Bern79">Bern79</a>].  Our thesis is that by filtering messages more
effectively, a receiver can <em> act</em> with better information (more
informedly<a name="504">&#160;</a>) and therefore more confidently.
<p>
<b> the medium<a name="505">&#160;</a></b>
<p>
There is strong evidence [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyle87">Wyle87</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Goul84">Goul84</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Rein85">Rein85</a>]
that subtle but far-reaching differences in
comprehension<a name="509">&#160;</a>, retention<a name="510">&#160;</a>, and
relevance<a name="511">&#160;</a> result from differences in the
medium<a name="512">&#160;</a> used for presenting a message.  For many
applications in which the data to be presented are text,
paper<a name="513">&#160;</a> is measurably superior to glass<a name="514">&#160;</a> (a
computer<a name="515">&#160;</a> display) for retention and
comprehension [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyle87">Wyle87</a>].  
Additionally, the demand for graphics<a name="517">&#160;</a>
and multi-media in the computer marketplace indicates that text itself
is not the only medium of choice for communicating most messages.
Although we do not agree with all of his assertions, Marshal McLuhan
<a name="518">&#160;</a> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205443/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Velt91">Velt91</a>] is probably correct in his
contention that media<a name="520">&#160;</a> 
are, in some sense, an extension of individuals<a name="521">&#160;</a>.
The apperception of a message is greatly affected by the 
medium<a name="522">&#160;</a> in
which it is expressed.  We shall limit ourselves to computer-related
media<a name="523">&#160;</a>; the advantages of so-called 
multi-media<a name="524">&#160;</a> in communicating a message are clear:  
<ul><li> More expressive power:  Media other than text give an author
  more and stronger channels of communication 
  <li> Compactness:  A picture can be worth a thousand words 
  <li> Involvement of more senses:  
  Multi-media includes sound, which can enhance the expressive
  power as well as the comprehension and retention of the message
</ul>
<p>
Thus differences in the form of the communications medium itself can
play a delicate but meaningful r&#244;le in the persuasiveness, relevance, 
and therefore the preferences and impact<a name="527">&#160;</a> of a 
message<a name="528">&#160;</a>.
