[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014211118/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Malo87">Malo87</a>] of anecdotal user acceptance can be applied to appraise
the usefulness of the Pasadena subscription service, then we can
conclude that the system is an unqualified success.  Many of the
researchers and other individuals using the system found it extremely
beneficial in their daily activities, not only to help them stay
informed about current topics of interest, but also to find specific
messages from the Matrix related to their work.  Surprisingly
sophisticated inclusion filtering stages were created to find very
specific text patterns among the millions of WAN messages passing
through the system.  The model of an SDI service delivering messages
via electronic mail also had a special appeal to certain individuals
who prefer email to other media for its timeliness, flexibility, and
ease of use.
<p>
However, the system was developed for the express purpose of evaluating
the viability of the staged filtering model as well as testing and
iteratively improving vector space retrieval methods.  Therefore, the
success or failure of Pasadena must be measured by the results of the
experiments performed within the system.  Because the usefulness and
adjusted usefulness values in most of the evaluations are relatively
low, the measured performance improvements (based on subscriber
preference relations) in the algorithms tested are also small.  We must
reluctantly conclude, therefore, that although we have introduced
significant improvements to existing algorithms, the amount of
improvement is relatively small.
