<p>
Precision - recall<a name="2677">&#160;</a><a name="2678">&#160;</a>
graphs <a name="2679">&#160;</a> 
from standardized test collections are used
pervasively in the IR literature to evaluate the performance of
retrieval systems.  These measures are simple, intuitive and
straightforward.  Researchers over the years have become comfortable
comparing retrieval performance using these measures, but many subtle
dangers arise when using them [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Fre91a">Fre91a</a>].  An important shortcoming
of these measures is their sensitivity to outlying values in an
experimental environment.  When too little data are used, there is no
indication of the <em> error</em> associated with their calculation.
<p>
Precision-oriented users<a name="2682">&#160;</a> 
are <a name="2683">&#160;</a>
interested in how many non-relevant or<a name="2684">&#160;</a>
``fallout'' messages they will have to view for a given retrieval set
size.  Recall-oriented users usually prefer to ascertain system
performance by counting how large a retrieval set size they must view
in order to obtain a certain number of relevant messages.  This subtle
but <a name="2685">&#160;</a><a name="2686">&#160;</a>
important effectiveness consideration is hidden by the
curve-smoothing process used to construct precision - recall graphs
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Fre91a">Fre91a</a>].  A number of other effectiveness measures that are
simple variations of precision - recall have been proposed to make up
for some of these shortcomings [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt83">Salt83</a>].  However, they all use
binary relevance assessments.  That is, these effectiveness evaluation
methods all use the absolute<a name="2689">&#160;</a> 
relevant / <a name="2690">&#160;</a>
non-relevant judgement as their cornerstone.

<br><strong>Figure 2.4:</strong> Definitions of Relevance<br>
<p>
<a name="3547">&#160;</a><a name="3548">&#160;</a>
<p>
The definitions appearing in some surveys and comparisons of relevance
measurement [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Lose91">Lose91</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Scha90">Scha90</a>] are summarized in 
figure <a href="node17.html#reldef">2.4</a>.  As we pointed out above, the key deficiency is the use
of absolute, direct judgement instead of preferences.  As many,
repeatable experiments have pointed out [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Frei91">Frei91</a>], the notion of
preference is much more powerful and useful in the evaluation of
information systems.
<p>
SDI<a name="3553">&#160;</a> 
services model the user's information<a name="3554">&#160;</a> 
need<a name="3555">&#160;</a> with a so-called <em>
user profile</em>.  <a name="3557">&#160;</a><a name="3558">&#160;</a>
One of the most important aspects of any SDI system is
how well a profile accurately and effectively mirrors its user's
information need.  Commercial SDI<a name="3559">&#160;</a> 
services<a name="3560">&#160;</a> 
use <a name="3561">&#160;</a>
a simple Boolean<a name="3562">&#160;</a><a name="3563">&#160;</a>
retrieval model and stored Boolean queries for user profiles.
Delivered items are usually not ranked, and when the effectiveness of
such systems is measured, the measurements always rely on statistics over
binary relevance assessments.
<p>
The usefulness of a retrieved item depends not only on its 
timeliness<a name="3564">&#160;</a>
and availability<a name="3565">&#160;</a>, 
but also on the user's <em> momentary</em> 
interest<a name="3567">&#160;</a> <a name="3568">&#160;</a> and
preferences.  It is also intuitively evident that the relevance and
usefulness of individual items in a rapidly changing source message
collection must be different from day to day.  Although definitions of
relevance in information retrieval are once again gaining attention in
the literature [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Lose91">Lose91</a>], measurements other than precision -
recall have unfortunately not been heavily exploited for performance
comparisons in evaluating new IR systems.
<p>
Usefulness [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Frei91">Frei91</a>] is an effectiveness measure which compares two
retrieval algorithms; given two algorithms, A and B, <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img142.gif"> expresses
whether A is more effective than B or vice versa.  A positive value
indicates that B is more effective than A; a negative value signifies
that B is less effective than A.  The measure is specifically suited to
measure IR algorithm performance in a WAN environment.  The notion of
item relevance in this effectiveness measure does not have to be an
absolute binary (relevant / non-relevant) judgement.  Instead,
subscribers may rank information relevance <em> relative</em> to other
items.  The viability of usefulness was demonstrated in [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyle91">Wyle91</a>]
and its advantages to traditional measures are evident in
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Fre91a">Fre91a</a>].  The subscription service implementation described in
chapter four employs the usefulness<a name="3574">&#160;</a> 
measure<a name="3575">&#160;</a> to evaluate algorithm
performance<a name="3576">&#160;</a>.
<p>
Usefulness uses <a name="3577">&#160;</a><a name="3578">&#160;</a>
all preference relations [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Boll87">Boll87</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wong88">Wong88</a>],
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Scha89">Scha89</a>] contained in each user's specification of the relative
relevance of the items delivered.  In the classical preference relation
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img143.gif"> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Boll87">Boll87</a>], a person's preference of one message <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img144.gif"> to
another <b>d</b> is represented as: <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img145.gif">.  This preference is
assumed to be based on the relative relevance of the two messages
to the person <b>p</b>.  These judgements are made by a person <em> after</em>
reviewing <b>d</b> and <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img146.gif">.  Partial preference relations <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img147.gif">
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Scha89">Scha89</a>] are similar to the classical preference relations, i.e.
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img148.gif"> also indicates that person <b>p</b> prefers message <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img149.gif"> to
<b>d</b>.  However, <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img150.gif"> does not indicate that <b>p</b> does
not prefer <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img151.gif"> to <b>d</b>.  Instead it means either <b>p</b> does not
prefer <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img152.gif"> to <b>d</b> or that <b>p</b> has not made a relevance judgement
concerning those two messages.
<p>
In order to express certain notions used in the creation of filtering
stages which we shall propose in the next chapter, we need to add a
temporal<a name="3590">&#160;</a><a name="3591">&#160;</a>
aspect to these relations.  Criticisms of IR evaluation
methods [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Swan88">Swan88</a>] point out that message relevance is time-dependent;
investigators <a name="3593">&#160;</a><a name="3594">&#160;</a>
have lamented the fact that no formal methods exist to 
model these dependencies [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Scha90">Scha90</a>].
<p>
Therefore, let us consider the notion of a time-dependent preference 
relation <a name="3652">&#160;</a>
denoted <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img154.gif">.  This relation simply designates person <b>p</b>'s
preference at a given instant in time <b>t</b>.  <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img155.gif"> means that
person <b>p</b> prefers <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img156.gif"> to <b>d</b> at time <b>t</b>.  If we restrict <b>t</b> to a
``universal present'' <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img157.gif"> or we assume that preferences do not change
over time, then <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img158.gif"> is identical to <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img159.gif">.  If <b>t</b>
is less than <b>0</b>, i.e. one considers past preferences, it becomes
possible to model partially the change in a person's preferences over
time.  In such a situation, the person would be tasked with specifying
preferences for a given set of messages at two or more separate times,
and an analysis could be performed of any differences in the two sets
of preferences.  For our purposes, however, we are not interested in
the <em> change</em> in user preferences over time, but rather in
<em> predicting</em> <a name="3607">&#160;</a><a name="3608">&#160;</a>
a preference at some future time.
<p>
As we shall see in detail in the next chapter, our requirement for a
temporal<a name="3609">&#160;</a> preference<a name="3610">&#160;</a> 
is related to new resource<a name="3611">&#160;</a> 
discovery<a name="3612">&#160;</a>.  In
general, when new information items become available for retrieval, no
preferences for these messages are available for determining whether or
not these new items should be viewed or not.  In fact, SDI retrieval
systems, based on stored subscriber profiles and retrieval algorithms,
form <em> system</em> preferences of these new items.  Evaluation of the
retrieval performance of such systems is then based on comparing these
system preferences to those supplied <em> at some later time</em> by a
subscriber.  When one considers the time dimension of this process, it
is apparent that an SDI system is really trying to <em> predict</em>
subscriber-preferences of newly arriving messages.
<p>
Let us consider positive values of <b>t</b> and the concept of
<em> conjectural</em> preference<a name="3617">&#160;</a>.  
A conjectural<a name="3618">&#160;</a> preference is defined as
follows:
<p>
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img160.gif"><p>
<p>
means that a retrieval algorithm forms the <em> conjecture</em> that person
<b>p</b> would prefer <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img161.gif"> to <b>d</b> at some future time <b>t</b> if <b>p</b> were to
view and compare <b>d</b> and <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img162.gif"> at time <b>t</b>.  Obviously, such 
speculative<a name="3622">&#160;</a><a name="3623">&#160;</a>
preferences can never be <em> measured</em>; they have some finite
probability of correctly predicting the future
outcome of a person's
judgements.  The question then arises, why even try formally to model
the future relative relevance judgements of some person?  As we alluded
earlier, the answer lies in the specification of a filtering stage
which is designed to find new sources of information which <em> would</em>
be preferred to other sources.
<p>
<a name="3626">&#160;</a>
<a name="3627">&#160;</a>
<a name="3628">&#160;</a>
<a name="3629">&#160;</a>
<p>
Using a set of conjectural preferences, we now define a mapping between
the classical definition of an ``optimal'' set<a name="3630">&#160;</a> of 
messages <a name="3631">&#160;</a> and the more
useful preference relations of newer relevance theories.  Let
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img163.gif"> be the exhaustive set of conjectural preferences
for <a name="3653">&#160;</a>
subscriber <b>s</b> and all message pairs <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img165.gif"> in the Matrix at some
future time <b>t</b>. <p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img166.gif"><p>
According to [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Scha89">Scha89</a>], these preference relations induce a perfect
ranking of equivalence classes.  Because the tuple set <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img167.gif"> is
defined as exhaustive, the equivalence classes contain individual
messages.  This ranking in turn yields a <em> numbering</em>
([<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Scha89">Scha89</a>], p. 18) which is identical to the rankings resulting
from the <b>RSV</b> functions defined in section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#methods">2.2</a>.  Using a
subscriber-defined cutoff point <b>c</b>, we can now define the ``optimal''
set of messages (i.e. the set containing all and only those messages
which the subscriber prefers to all others in the Matrix at time <b>t</b>)
to be the set containing the <b>c</b> highest ranked messages induced by the
exhaustive set of conjectural preference relations <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205822im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img168.gif">.  As
we shall see in the next chapter, an analysis involving this set can be
used to define partially a subscriber's future information need.  Such
a model can then be used to construct specific filtering stages aimed
at optimizing retrieval performance by targeting specific qualities of
this optimal set in their definition.  This set can also form the basis
for methods aimed at assisting subscribers at new resource discovery.
<p>
In this chapter we defined a new model for querying the Matrix, and
established an advanced feature weighting function to be incorporated
in vector space ranking algorithms based on paragraph <em> types</em> in
WAN messages.  We also examined some effectiveness matters, concluding
that the usefulness measure is best suited for analyzing the
effectiveness of WAN-based retrieval systems or any system which has a
large or highly dynamic message collection.  Finally, we introduced the
notion of temporal preferences, including conjectural preferences which
approximate a future preference.  We come now to the heart
of this work, namely our approach to <em> filtering</em> the Matrix.
