<p>
The <a name="6624">&#160;</a>
Matrix is a natural dissemination medium for Luhn's SDI model.
Simplex (broadcast) communications media such as radio, television, or
newspapers are economically viable only if a large group of people
subscribe to the service.  At the other extreme, telephones, facsimile
transfer (FAX), letters, and other duplex (point-to-point)
communications media become economically untenable after only a small
number of people are linked together.  The synergy resulting from the
marriage of general-purpose computers to electronic networks makes
possible a new and in some respects better solution to the problem of
effectively disseminating information: <em> electronic filtering
services</em>.  In this chapter we present an implementation of
the <b>IS</b> model described in the last chapter.  The <b>IS</b> described here
is an email subscription service that retrieves messages from diverse
sources and sends them to subscribers via email; the system also
includes client - server network transparent software for interactively
browsing dynamic message collections and updating a subscriber's
profile.
<p>
We developed the Pasadena (<b> P</b>eriodic, <b> a</b>synchronous <b>
s</b>elective extr<b> a</b>ction and <b> d</b>iss<b> e</b>mination of
information through <b> n</b>etwork <b> a</b>ccess) system as a test-bed
for evaluating the models presented in the previous chapters
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210238/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyle89">Wyle89</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210238/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyle91">Wyle91</a>].  The system also happens to provide a
useful service to its subscribers in spite of the fact that they are
used as test subjects for numerous IR performance experiments.
This overview of the Pasadena subscription service is organized as
follows.  First we concisely summarize how the system works; we
describe the query of remote sources, the maintenance of local
databases, interacting with users, and the evaluation of IR
algorithms.   Then we describe some interesting aspects of the system
implementation, and finally we summarize the many experiments used to
evaluate IR algorithms run in Pasadena and give a summary of
those results.
<p>
Figure <a href="node24.html#overview">4.1</a> is a general block diagram of the Pasadena
system.  Pasadena actively queries diverse information sources using
equations <a href="node24.html#eqwindowavg">2.4</a> and <a href="node24.html#eqavgarrive">2.7</a> to optimize the
query rates; the system maintains a local database of current
information items, deleting older information and adding new items
continually.  The system manages user-dialog, starts and runs the
indexing and retrieval algorithms, and administers the similarity
measures for comparing query texts with information items.  It also
provides facilities for profile management and process scheduling.

<p>
Any person or entity which can use networked electronic mail and is
reachable on the Matrix can become a subscriber of the Pasadena
system.  Using the email interface implementation of the passive
user-model discussed in section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210238/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node19.html#passive">3.1</a>, individuals subscribe
to the Pasadena system through a four-step process.  First, they send a
message containing the word ``help'' to the system.  A message is sent
back explaining what the service is and how to register.  This first
help message, like all other messages sent out by the system, is itself
a registration ``form'' with several leading ``comments'' which a
would-be subscriber can modify with his own 
information.  After registration, a users manual is mailed out
electronically.  This manual contains instructions for formulating and
refining queries.  The third step is the formulation of queries, each
of which contains the formal parameters described in the last chapter.
After submitting at least one query and receiving some messages,
subscribers are encouraged to refine the query in order to enhance
retrieval performance.  Additionally, a ``prod'' interval 
determines when the system automatically prompts the subscriber
to make changes.  All parameters in each query of the profile can be
changed.  Some changes to enhance a typical low-performance query
include: increasing the query interval in order to increase the size of
the dynamic message collection formed between executions; changing the
query text; adding exclusion patterns to filter out non-relevant
messages containing a specific text pattern; and specifying a larger
number of messages to be retrieved to increase recall performance.
<p>
Pasadena's information sources are extremely heterogeneous as far as
subject matter is concerned.  The bulk of the information items come
from commercial news agencies that distribute their messages via Usenet
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210238/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Ande87">Ande87</a>] newsgroups; however, the system also receives messages
from mailing lists and actively queries passive WAN-accessible
databases for new information.  All of these sources contain pure-text
items which are meant for electronic distribution in the Matrix.  In
addition to the usual mailing list and distributed electronic bulletin
board system (bbs) messages [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210238/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyle89">Wyle89</a>], Pasadena also taps
information from news wire services.  These news items are usually only
a paragraph or two in length, and adhere to the Associated Press (AP)
style guide for journalistic prose.  Such messages are ultimately
targeted at paper publication and dissemination.  All of these
heterogeneous information categories have an important characteristic in
common, namely that the news they contain is timely.  The value of the
information they comprise is therefore dependent upon quick
distribution.  Receiving such information a week too late is like
reading a week-old newspaper.  Subscribers typically set their query
intervals to span at most a few days because they have come to expect
prompt service from services in the Matrix.
<p>
Each subscriber has a single profile which contains one or more
queries.  Each query is composed of a comparison text and several
parameters described in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210238/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node20.html#stages">3.2</a>.  The Pasadena system manages
user-dialog, coordinates the execution of the indexing and retrieval
algorithms, and administers the similarity measures for comparing query
texts with information item texts.  The system provides facilities for
profile management and interactive browsing of the entire database of
cached WAN messages.  It also keeps track of the experiments currently
running in the system, and stores state information about which
algorithm generated which ranked list of messages for which
subscriber.
<p>
The experiments concentrate on measuring the performance of the vector
space algorithms described in the previous chapter.  These algorithms
are used in Pasadena's third filtering stage to rank the ``promising''
messages passing through the first two stages of the filter.  Using
carefully controlled, experiments in which only one
component of a ranking algorithm is varied, we try to discover which
components of the vector space algorithms perform better in the
Pasadena SDI service and why.
<p>
Within a single query of each subscriber's profile, the retrieval set
size parameter determines how many messages the subscriber wishes to
receive for that query.  A separate, query-specific parameter
determines how often Pasadena should deliver information related to the
query.  At these intervals, the Pasadena delivers those items with the 
highest retrieval status values along with feedback forms.
<p>
The Pasadena system is a straightforward implementation (see section
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210238/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node27.html#implementation">4.4</a> below) of the model described in section
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210238/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node20.html#filter">3.2</a>.  Dynamic message collections are formed for each
query by the database category and exclusion filtering stages.
These dynamic collections are further limited to contain only messages which
have arrived in the system since the last time the query was
evaluated.  The messages in such a dynamic collection are ranked by
both vector space algorithms currently being evaluated.  Both
algorithms compute a RSV for each message for the query.  Ranking is
then simply the descending order of RSVs.  Ranks in a set of identical
RSVs are arbitrary.  The set of messages that is eventually sent to the
subscriber for the given query is built up step-wise from the highest
ranked messages of each retrieval algorithm.  Messages chosen to be
sent to a subscriber because they matched the inclusion pattern are
also ranked by both vector space algorithms.  If neither vector space
algorithm gives these messages a high rank (retrieves them) then these
messages do not contribute to the usefulness performance measure.
<p>
At the time of this writing, Pasadena extracts data from its sources at
approximately ten Mbyte per day; simultaneously, ten Mbytes of older
data are deleted each day.  Newswire services and certain Usenet
newsgroups [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210238/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Ande87">Ande87</a>] are polled daily; other databases are polled
aperiodically, based on a moving average of their update rates
(equation <a href="node24.html#eqavgarrive">2.7</a>).  Although the rate of growth of WAN
queryable source data is still exponential, such a phenomenon cannot
continue for more than a few more years.  Currently, users are limited
to queries spanning ten days; the maximum data volume excluding
indexing overhead at any given time is therefore 100 Mbyte.  As new,
better newswire services and other sources of information become
available on WANs, this volume could grow.
<p>
Pasadena's basic system architecture is in fact easily course grain
parallelisable.  The rate determining steps of Pasadena's processing
cycle are the information retrieval RSV functions (called <em> ranking
algorithms</em> in the system).  It is practically quite simple to run
several comparisons in parallel on separate processors, or several
queries in parallel on different incarnations of Pasadena.  The system
also scales well with the size and speed of its native hardware /
software environment.  Computer hardware advances therefore would allow
Pasadena gracefully to keep pace with growing data volume.
<p>
In this section, the SDI framework for the Pasadena subscription
service was outlined, and the overall system architecture was
discussed.  The remote data sources and heterogeneous data were
considered, and some general issues about implementing the <b>IS</b> model
from the last two chapters were also presented.  We come now to some of the
specific design considerations for implementing the remote query
and user profile models mentioned in the last chapter.
