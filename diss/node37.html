<h1><a name="SECTION001020000000000000000"> Performance Evaluation in an Information Server</a></h1>
<p>
One of the fundamental problems with the vast proliferation of computer
systems and computer networks is the effective dissemination and
retrieval of newly available <em> dynamic</em> information.  Because of its
exponential growth, the WAN information base within the Matrix has
become more difficult to query and use.  On the other hand, electronic
mail and user-friendly client - server network software have
established themselves as well-defined mechanisms for communicating
between people and computer systems both within an organization and
over a WAN between machines thousands of kilometers distant.  With this
growing connectivity, it is a natural idea to couple the WAN
information sources to individual WAN users through an SDI subscription
service.  The key element of such an information server (<b>IS</b>) is its
ability effectively to <em> filter</em> the WAN-available information for
its subscribers.
<p>
However, it is impossible to measure this filtering ability in a
real-world situation using the classical effectiveness measures
developed for static documents and small standard test collections.
Hence, we applied the usefulness effectiveness measure, which is
particularly suited to the dynamic message collections found in a
subscription service.  The choice of effectiveness measure can be one
of the most important aspects in information retrieval science because
it provides for the accurate, empirical <em> measurement</em> of retrieval
and filtering methods in a real-world environment.  The usefulness
measure is very well suited to gauge algorithm performance in the
dynamic environment of the Matrix.  The measure uses all preference
relations contained in each subscriber's ranking of a retrieved set of
messages.  The notion of relevance in this effectiveness measure is not
an absolute binary (relevant / non-relevant) judgement.  Instead,
subscribers rank information relevance <em> relative</em> to other items.
The usefulness measure also includes an error probability calculation
that is very helpful in experimental evaluation of algorithm
performance.  The error calculation indicates the reliability of the
measured difference in performance between two algorithms, and therefore
provides a stopping criterion for on-going experiments.
<p>
The objectives of the theoretical model and implementation of this
information server project are:
<ul><li> to test the viability of the concept of <em> filtering in stages</em>
        in a large-scale realistic environment,
  <li> to provide a testbed for the iterative development of
        high-performance vector-space retrieval algorithms, and
        secondarily,
  <li> to provide a useful service to subscribers.
</ul>
<p>
The general framework of filtering in stages is not only more flexible
for the implementor of an <b>IS</b>, but also advantageous to subscribers
using such systems.  Each of the filtering stages described in 
section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014211041/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node20.html#stages">3.2</a> is targeted at a single, well-defined aspect of the
subscriber's information need.  This specificity provides a clearer,
more direct method for a subscriber to express his information need.
It also entails more tractable and direct methods for a subscriber to
make changes to his profile to keep it more isomorphic with his actual
information need as covered by the highly dynamic Matrix.  Profiles
within our <b>IS</b> model include a mechanism to help subscribers discover
new Matrix resources as they become available.  This aspect of a
subscriber's information need is modeled formally by the notion of a
conjectural preference.
<p>
Experiments run within the Pasadena <b>IS</b> give empirical evidence that
our proposed phrase generation technique based on the symmetric
extension of high-noise words as well as the inverse feature density
term weighting function (both described in section<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014211041/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#methods">2.2</a>)
provide better retrieval performance in a WAN information environment
than any other retrieval method.
