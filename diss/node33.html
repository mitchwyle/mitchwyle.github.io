<h2><a name="SECTION00946000000000000000"> Retrieval Methods Tested</a></h2>
<p>
In order to test components of the system during its initial
implementation, simple Boolean indexing and retrieval methods were
developed together with the main daemon program.  The retrieval
strategy in these Boolean algorithms used simple coordination level
matching [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt83">Salt83</a>] to generate RSVs.  A simple variation of Boolean
coordination level matching using normalization [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Gige89">Gige89</a>] was
contrasted to standard coordination level matching.  The results of
these very early experiments, which were primarily used for exercising
the system, verified well-known results from the literature, namely that
normalization of Boolean queries provides slightly better retrieval 
performance.
<p>
In addition to these simple Boolean algorithms, several different IR
algorithms were implemented and tested in the Pasadena system.  These
methods implement algorithms based on 
the equations presented in the second chapter.
To find out which components of the methods tested were responsible for
performance differences, we systematically ran experiments whereby one
component of one method was varied, then measured the retrieval
performance of the variation relative to the baseline algorithms and to
each other.  These variations include the extent of word reduction, the type
of features used in indexing, the text comparison RSV function, and
the various term weighting methods from sections <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#methods">2.2</a> and
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#secstruc">2.3</a>.
<p>
The baseline method against which most algorithms were compared uses
Porter [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Port80">Port80</a>]
reduced words as indexing features, equation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#eqwtbase">2.9</a>
for feature weighting (<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img375.gif">),
and the standard cosine function for RSV calculation.  Henceforth we
shall refer to this method as <b> psw</b> (a mnemonic for 
``<b> P</b>orter-<b> s</b>temmed <b> w</b>ords).''
<p>
A simple variation of the <b> psw</b> method uses S-stemmed words for
features. In this method, only certain plural words are reduced to
their singular forms; this method is implemented simply by using the
first two rules of Porter's reduction algorithm.  Feature weighting and
RSV calculation are identical to those of <b> psw</b>.  This method is
referred to as <b> ssw</b>, a mnemonic for ``<b> S</b>-<b> s</b>temmed 
<b> w</b>ords.''
<p>
Another variation of the <b> psw</b> method uses an indirect similarity
measure (see section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#methods">2.2</a>, equation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#eqrsvblen">2.11</a>)
instead of the cosine RSV function.  This method is called <b> pwi</b>, a
mnemonic for ``<b> P</b>orter reduced <b> w</b>ords, <b> i</b>ndirect 
similarity.''
<p>
The first published results from the experiments run in the
Pasadena system compared the use of N-grams as indexing features to
S-stemmed words [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyle91">Wyle91</a>].  The method <b> ng</b> (a mnemonic for
``<b> N</b>-<b> g</b>rams''), uses the indirect similarity RSV function in 
equation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#eqrsvblen">2.11</a> and overlapping N-grams for indexing features.  
The standard <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img376.gif"> (equation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#eqwtbase">2.9</a>)
feature weighting function is used for term
weighting.
<p>
A variation of the N-gram method using the cosine direct similarity
instead of the indirect similarity method was also implemented.  This
variation is called <b> ngc</b> for ``<b> N</b>-<b> g</b>ram <b> c</b>osine.''
<p>
For a detailed description of these N-gram methods, including the motivations
for and reasoning behind the use of N-grams and indirect similarity,
see [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Teuf89">Teuf89</a>] and [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyle91">Wyle91</a>].  In the latter work, the
performance differences resulting from these variations of <b> ng</b> and
<b> psw</b> were compared using the Pasadena system.  Some of the results
in that work were inconclusive because of high error probabilities
resulting from insufficient data.  New performance data contrasting
these algorithms is reported here (see below, section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node34.html#secexp">4.5</a>
and appendix <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node42.html#rez">B</a>).
<p>
Another method implemented and tested in the Pasadena system is based
on the use of simple phrases [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Faga87">Faga87</a>] as indexing features.   In
this method, combinations of Porter reduced words from the query are
extended to phrases, and these phrases along with all single words are
used as indexing features.  <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img377.gif"> is used to weight the features,
and the cosine function is used for the RSV calculation.  This method is
called <b> sph</b>, a mnemonic ``for <b> s</b>imple <b> ph</b>rases.''
<p>
The phrase generation method described in section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node22.html#phrases">3.4</a> was,
of course, also implemented in the Pasadena system.  The Porter
reduction algorithm is used on all words.  The resulting set of
individual words combined with phrases constructed from the symmetric
extension of high-noise
words are used as indexing features for the similarity measures.  The
indirect similarity RSV function is used.  Three different feature
weighting functions were implemented, the standard <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img378.gif"> 
(equation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#eqwtbase">2.9</a>), a simple
variation of the standard function where the message frequency is
hyperbolically normalized (equation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#eqwtnorm">2.10</a>), and feature
weights based on their inverse message density (equation
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#eqwtipdn">2.16</a>).  The first variation of this method using
<img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img379.gif"> is called <b> nph</b>, for ``<b> n</b>oise discriminated words
to <b> ph</b>rases.''  The variation of this method that uses normalized
message frequency feature weighting is called <b> npn</b>, a mnemonic
for ``<b> n</b>oise discriminated words to <b> p</b>hrases, <b>
n</b>ormalized.''  The final variation using both message frequency
normalization and the inverse message density factor is called <b> npi</b> 
for ``<b> n</b>oise discriminated words to <b> p</b>hrases with <b> i</b>nverse
message density.''
<p>
A variation of the proposed flexible text matching system using
different context granularities proposed by Salton and Buckley
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt91">Salt91</a>] and described in section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#secstruc">2.3</a> was also
implemented in the Pasadena system.  The term weighting function
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#eqwts2">2.12</a> and retrieval function <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#rsvsal">2.13</a> were implemented
using two granularity levels, the so-called global context (entire
message) and the paragraph context.  The mnemonic for this method is <b>
sps</b> for ``<b> S</b>alton <b> p</b>aragraph <b> s</b>ystem.''
<p>
Finally, a method incorporating the inverse feature density term
weighting (equation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#ipd">2.14</a>) that uses statistics based on paragraph
<em> types</em> (section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#secstruc">2.3</a>) was implemented using the
standard cosine RSV function and Porter stemmed words as indexing
features.  This method is labelled <b> ipd</b>, a mnemonic for 
``<b> i</b>nverse feature in <b> p</b>aragraph <b> d</b>ensity.''
<p>
All of these algorithms are constructed from variations of the same
basic modules and are structured identically (see figures <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node32.html#p7">4.5</a> and
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node32.html#p8">4.6</a>).  They all use similar data structures for indexing and
ranking, but the retrieval algorithms differ significantly.
<p>
In this section we discussed the implementation of the Pasadena system,
highlighting some of its unique features and interesting aspects of the
system realization.  Pasadena consists of a relatively small core
daemon program that coordinates and manages the scheduling, execution,
and data management of several other semi-independent components.  This
daemon process also handles subscribers profile management including
executing user commands.  A separate selective information extraction
system querys remote databases aperiodically based on the information
flow parameters discussed in section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210812/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node14.html#aperiodic">2.1</a>.  The main daemon
program has a well-defined interface to different IR indexing and
retrieval algorithms that are implemented as a set of separate
executable programs.  The software architecture and implementation of
twelve major algorithms tested in the system was presented briefly.  We
come now to the results of the numerous experiments run in the system to
test the retrieval performance of these twelve algorithms.
