<p>
Advances in computer hardware and telecommunications technology have
spawned an exponential growth of the <em> Matrix</em> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Quar90">Quar90</a>], a
worldwide meta-network<a name="156">&#160;</a> of 
connected computer networks<a name="157">&#160;</a> and 
conferencing<a name="158">&#160;</a><a name="159">&#160;</a>
systems; the Matrix provides unique services that are similar to but more
powerful than those of the telephone<a name="160">&#160;</a>, 
post office, library or telefax<a name="161">&#160;</a>.
The Matrix consists of WANs; each WAN<a name="162">&#160;</a> 
links thousands (or hundreds of
thousands) of computers together and provides a distributed
computer-mediated communications<a name="163">&#160;</a> 
system to millions of users.
Information is delivered quickly over large geographical distances;
information sources for IR are no longer limited to a single machine, a
local area network (LAN<a name="164">&#160;</a>), a metropolitan area network 
(MAN<a name="165">&#160;</a>), or even a single wide-area network (WAN).
<p>
Communities<a name="166">&#160;</a> of 
individuals congeal around particular WANs and topics of
discussion supported by the Matrix.  Preexisting communities use this medium
to further their goals.  New applications<a name="167">&#160;</a> 
of the Matrix
include tasks that could ordinarily not be completed in time to be useful
without computer networks.  These tasks<a name="168">&#160;</a> include:
<p>
<ul><li> The coordination<a name="170">&#160;</a> 
  of large software projects with many programmers or
  individuals separated by large geographical distances
  <li> Data transfer<a name="171">&#160;</a><a name="172">&#160;</a> 
  for coordination of astronomical<a name="173">&#160;</a> 
  observations
  <li> Medical data<a name="174">&#160;</a> transfer<a name="175">&#160;</a>
  <li> News<a name="176">&#160;</a> of political<a name="177">&#160;</a> situations
  <li> The production<a name="178">&#160;</a><a name="179">&#160;</a>
  of scholarly reports<a name="180">&#160;</a> and 
  books<a name="181">&#160;</a>
  <li> Scientific collaboration<a name="182">&#160;</a> 
  in Biology<a name="183">&#160;</a>, Chemistry<a name="184">&#160;</a>, 
  Physics<a name="185">&#160;</a>
</ul>
<p>
As the Matrix expands, each of these application areas requires better
methods to access<a name="187">&#160;</a> and filter the
information<a name="188">&#160;</a> flood.  The ultimate application
of this thesis is to provide a foundation<a name="189">&#160;</a> 
for developing and using such methods.
<p>
Alan Kay<a name="190">&#160;</a> has informally <a name="191">&#160;</a>
proposed ``semi-intelligent software programs
that you can delegate your goals to <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img9.gif"> that will act like your
personal news reporters, whose jobs will be to scour the networks that
you are connected to and find things that are relevant to the goals you
are pursuing right now. <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img10.gif"> their job is not just to find
anecdotes but also tools and other kinds of things that are related to
what you are doing'' [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Kay91">Kay91</a>].  Related ideas are now appearing in
diverse areas of computer science literature (for a survey, see
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Seel91">Seel91</a>]).  SDI software systems could be considered a kind of
agent, but most existing SDI systems have a human 
intermediary<a name="194">&#160;</a> or
organization involved in their use.  Furthermore, these systems do not
help their subscribers with the discovery<a name="195">&#160;</a> 
of other information<a name="196">&#160;</a>
resources.  Commercial<a name="197">&#160;</a> SDI services obviously 
do not want to encourage
their subscribers to use competing services, and public systems (for
example in libraries) are not designed to assist resource discovery
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Maur74">Maur74</a>].  Another class of software systems which may loosely be
considered ``agents'' are systems which store and execute a list of
commands on behalf of the user at specified times.  Such systems exist
in most computing environments, and are typically used in conjunction
with non-interactive software<a name="199">&#160;</a>.  
Employing such systems in conjunction
with a sophisticated ``user-emulation<a name="200">&#160;</a>'' or 
scripting<a name="201">&#160;</a> system<a name="202">&#160;</a> would
approximate Kay's concept more closely.  One can conclude that agents,
in general, are still in a developmental stage; it is probable that
they will become more prominent in the future<a name="203">&#160;</a>.
<p>
We shall now review the major software designs for retrieving
information from the Matrix.  The most notable WAN-based
information<a name="204">&#160;</a> server models include the
WAIS<a name="205">&#160;</a> project, [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Kahl91">Kahl91</a>], the internet
gopher<a name="207">&#160;</a><a name="208">&#160;</a>[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Albe91">Albe91</a>], the
information lens<a name="210">&#160;</a><a name="211">&#160;</a>
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Malo87">Malo87</a>], the distributed<a name="213">&#160;</a> indexing model
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Danz91">Danz91</a>], Xanadu<a name="215">&#160;</a> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Nels88">Nels88</a>], 
and the polychannel<a name="217">&#160;</a> system<a name="218">&#160;</a>
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Giff90">Giff90</a>].
<p>
WAIS is an IR system developed by Thinking<a name="220">&#160;</a>
Machines Inc. for searching inverted<a name="221">&#160;</a> file text
databases available over a WAN.  It is based on a two-tiered
search<a name="222">&#160;</a> strategy whereby a user first queries a
directory<a name="223">&#160;</a> of database servers for choosing
appropriate source<a name="224">&#160;</a> databases, and then queries
the databases<a name="225">&#160;</a> themselves for messages.  The directory
of servers can be a WAN-distributed database [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Ever90">Ever90</a>].  In the
baseline WAIS implementation, the directory of servers is centrally
located at one node on in the Matrix.  However, the domain-name server
(DNS) [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Ever90">Ever90</a>] distributed database system has been grafted into
WAIS to solve the <a name="228">&#160;</a>
single-point-of-failure and access<a name="229">&#160;</a> problems of a
central<a name="230">&#160;</a> directory.  The network
protocol<a name="231">&#160;</a>, user-interface, and retrieval
algorithm in WAIS can use
relevance<a name="232">&#160;</a><a name="233">&#160;</a> feedback
data to incorporate terms from relevant documents into the query.  In
the WAIS model, the directory of servers does not contain much
information about the source databases themselves and is not updated
when source collections change.  This drawback may be a fatal flaw in
the WAIS architecture [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Giff90">Giff90</a>].  The original design concept of
the system [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Kahl89">Kahl89</a>] calls for an SDI component, called ``dynamic
folders<a name="236">&#160;</a><a name="237">&#160;</a>,'' 
in which queries would automatically, periodically be
executed.  In this ``dynamic folders'' proposal, a special file
directory has an agent associated with it.  The state information of
the agent is called a ``charter<a name="238">&#160;</a>'' 
and consists of a Boolean database
query, a list of asynchronous event types and a time interval for
re-running the query as well as some user-interface semantics.  No
viable realization of this concept has emerged from the WAIS project,
however.
<p>
The internet gopher<a name="239">&#160;</a><a name="240">&#160;</a> is similar to
WAIS, but is based on a much simpler client-server protocol; it
provides a distributed <em> hierarchy<a name="241">&#160;</a></em> of full-text
messages from several host machines in the Matrix.  The client part can
either browse<a name="242">&#160;</a> the directory hierarchy and documents of
several servers, or issue a Boolean query to a single server.  Such
queries range over all documents contained in that server.  The goal of
the gopher project is to present users of a
<a name="243">&#160;</a>campus-wide
information<a name="244">&#160;</a> system with a single,
network-transparent, unified view<a name="245">&#160;</a> of the
information resources on the campus; the metaphor<a name="246">&#160;</a> is a
local computer file-system and file searching software.  There is no
SDI component in the internet gopher.
<p>
Malone's information<a name="247">&#160;</a><a name="248">&#160;</a>
lens is an email user agent<a name="249">&#160;</a> (UA<a name="250">&#160;</a>) with
filtering and mailing list<a name="251">&#160;</a> capabilities.  Such
features are quite common in email user agents [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyl89a">Wyl89a</a>].  A unique
feature of the information lens is the email alias
``anyone<a name="253">&#160;</a>'' to which users can send a message which will
then be readable by all users in an organization.  Users specify
filtering rules by filling in forms<a name="254">&#160;</a> or
templates<a name="255">&#160;</a>, which can retrieve messages sent to
``anyone.'' The email filtering functions include the usual sorting,
pre-filing, and deletion.  The information lens user-interface
incorporates a concept similar to our <em> palette of examples</em> (see
section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node19.html#passive">3.1</a>) user-interface dialog whereby the system
presents menus<a name="258">&#160;</a> for the construction of
filtering<a name="259">&#160;</a> rules<a name="260">&#160;</a> which
help guide users through the creation<a name="261">&#160;</a> of new
rules.  We take this concept a step further by furnishing complete
examples instead of a myriad of menu choices.
<p>
The distributed<a name="262">&#160;</a><a name="263">&#160;</a>
indexing model is a vague proposal for a distributed database and
retrieval system to be used by information providers on the Matrix.  It
prescribes a complex, hierarchical<a name="264">&#160;</a>,
cooperating network<a name="265">&#160;</a> protocol instead of the
now standard client-server paradigm.  The advantage of this model is
its scalability<a name="266">&#160;</a>; the authors claim it can easily
handle <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img11.gif"> network nodes.  One major disadvantage of the proposal is
the assumption that all Matrix resource providers can and will
cooperate with ``index brokers<a name="267">&#160;</a>'' (the postulated
intermediate<a name="268">&#160;</a> systems); another drawback is
the large amount of data redundancy<a name="269">&#160;</a><a name="270">&#160;</a> and replicated storage<a name="271">&#160;</a>
overhead<a name="272">&#160;</a> it requires to cache<a name="273">&#160;</a> the
requests and data.  This system also appears to be in an early
conceptual phase of development, as no implementations have been
reported.
<p>
The Xanadu<a name="274">&#160;</a> project is hypertext inventor 
Ted<a name="275">&#160;</a> Nelson's ambitious attempt
to create a system providing the simultaneous connection and access of
all published text in the world via hypertext<a name="276">&#160;</a> 
links<a name="277">&#160;</a> which span the
Matrix.  A new file 
system<a name="278">&#160;</a> is proposed with 
network<a name="279">&#160;</a> transparent
hypertext<a name="280">&#160;</a> 
links<a name="281">&#160;</a> 
embedded in its design.  Although a few Xanadu
booths<a name="282">&#160;</a> have 
been installed in one U.S. city, the concept has had
neither commercial success nor widespread academic acceptance.  Other
network transparent hypermedia systems have been proposed (a broad
survey can be found in [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Micha91">Micha91</a>]; retrieval models for large
hypermedia webs are described in [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014205329/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Fre91c">Fre91c</a>])<a name="285">&#160;</a>. 
IR based on hypermedia<a name="286">&#160;</a>
webs have taken directions outside of Nelson's original doctrine.
Xanadu includes no SDI provisions and retrieval itself is based solely
on interactive browsing<a name="287">&#160;</a>.
<p>
Gifford's<a name="288">&#160;</a> Polychannel<a name="289">&#160;</a>
model<a name="290">&#160;</a> is based on both
broadcast<a name="291">&#160;</a> (simplex<a name="292">&#160;</a>)
media<a name="293">&#160;</a><a name="294">&#160;</a> such as
radio<a name="295">&#160;</a> or cable<a name="296">&#160;</a> TV in a metropolitan area
network<a name="297">&#160;</a> (MAN<a name="298">&#160;</a>) and
traditional (duplex<a name="299">&#160;</a>) digital communications media in the
Matrix.  Subscribers receive a constant stream<a name="300">&#160;</a> of
information<a name="301">&#160;</a> from the simplex medium and
actively store only information matching a local
filtering<a name="302">&#160;</a> specification.  Subscribers can
formulate queries via the duplex communications medium in order to
retrieve messages which do not match their local
filters<a name="303">&#160;</a>.  The system is based on simple text matching
and includes no IR ranking<a name="304">&#160;</a> or similarity measures.
