<h2><a name="SECTION00945000000000000000"> Information Retrieval Algorithm Interface</a></h2>
<p>
Each indexing and retrieval algorithm in Pasadena consists of a set of
separate executable programs.  The <tt> irintrf</tt> 
described in section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210733/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node28.html#irintrf">4.4.1</a> module (see figure
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210733/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node28.html#modstruc">4.2</a>) in the main Pasadena daemon program runs the
appropriate programs from each algorithm currently being evaluated; it
handles incremental indexing, query creation and deletion, retrieval
status value generation, etc.  <tt> irintrf</tt> supplies the programs with
run-time parameters such as source file names and index identification
information.  The interface allows each algorithm to maintain its own
index file(s), and other indexing information without specifying
details about how and where the indexes should be stored.  This
interface, at the operating system process level, offers a high degree of
flexibility and insulates the main daemon program somewhat from
catastrophic failures of the IR algorithm components.
<p>
The separate executable programs comprising a retrieval algorithm in the
Pasadena system include
<ul><li> <tt> open-news</tt>: This program is called by Pasadena to tell each active
   algorithm that a new virtual day is starting.
There are three arguments passed to this program:
<ol><li> The home directory of the algorithm as specified in the system 
parameter file.
<li> The name of the error log file to which the program should write
errors.  If errors occur, the program should write to this file a
descriptive text string explaining the error.  If the program aborts, it
should also return an error code indicating the severity of the problem.
<li> The unique virtual day number.  This number is used to identify the
current day; it is also used by <tt> close-news</tt> to delete expired message
indexes and must therefore also appear as part of the identifier of a 
news message.
</ol>
  <li> <tt> close-news</tt>:  This program is run to delete older messages.  
Its calling parameters are identical to open-news, but its function is
to delete all index entries for the virtual day.
  <li> <tt> process-news</tt>: This program is called once per algorithm for each
new message that enters the system.  Typical indexing steps involve 
stoplist word elimination, word reduction, 
counting term frequencies, and storing
these data in an index.  The arguments passed to the program include:
<ol><li> The home directory of the algorithm
<li> The name of the error log file
<li> The unique virtual day number  
<li> Unique message number.  
This number is unique <em> only</em> with respect to
the day; messages and message indexes 
must therefore always be identified by the day and 
message numbers.
<li>  File name of original message.  
</ol>
<p>
There are two distinct classes of <tt> process-news</tt> algorithms.  The
first class employs only a direct similarity measure and the second
class uses both a direct and an indirect similarity measure (from
section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210733/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#methods">2.2</a> ; see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210733/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node34.html#secexp">4.5</a> below).
Although there is some overlap, the module structures differ among the two
classes of algorithms.  Both classes include scanners and parsers for
optimal traversal through the formatted sections of message files.  All
programs also use the same efficient implementation of Knuth's
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210733/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Knut73">Knut73</a>] open hashing algorithm for variable sized text records,
stoplist management, word stemming, and a space-efficient string
allocation mechanism proposed by Wirth [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210733/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wirt86">Wirt86</a>].  The more
complicated algorithms using indirect similarity RSV functions also include a
module that implements the reformulated noise measure from section
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210733/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node22.html#phrases">3.4</a>.  This algorithm uses a heap memory model to calculate
the information theoretical noise in an uncontrolled vocabulary of
features.  These indirect similarity algorithms also contain a module 
that provides faster (cached) access to indexing tokens occurring in 
queries and any messages from the collection that have at least one 
token in common with the given query.
<p>
<li> <tt> process-batch:</tt> This program is almost identical to 
<tt> process-news</tt>. The last few calling parameters are a ``batch file''
name instead of a single news item file and the source directory
of the message files.  The program indexes each message file
named in the batch file instead of just one individual message.  <tt>
process-batch</tt> is normally invoked when a new algorithm is first
installed, to let the algorithm quickly ``catch up'' by indexing all
existing news items in the Pasadena system at the time it is
installed.
<p>
<li> <tt> process-query:</tt> This program indexes queries, and is usually
very similar to the process-news program.  In most cases it imports all
the same modules and performs similar indexing on queries as is done
for messages by <tt> process-news</tt>.  The calling parameters are identical to
those of <tt> process-news</tt>, except that a unique query number is given
instead of the virtual day and message numbers.
<p>
<li> <tt> remove-query:</tt> This program removes the query index for the
given query number.  In virtually all algorithm implementations, it is
a trivial program which removes a query index file.
<p>
<li> <tt> get-ranking:</tt> This program calculates and returns the <b>n</b>
highest retrieval status values for a single query and a batch of
message files.  It is the most important program for each retrieval
algorithm and varies the most from algorithm to algorithm.  In addition
to the usual environment, error logging, and directory parameters, of
the programs mentioned above, <tt> get-ranking</tt> is also passed a query
number, and a dynamic message collection (batch file) 
in the form of a list of
virtual day number - message number pairs; each pair identifies a
specific message (or message index) to be compared to the query (or query
index).  A list of real-valued RSVs and message identifiers (day and
item numbers) is returned in descending sorted
order of RSV.  In the current implementation, only the top 50 values are
returned, i.e. subscribers may not receive more than 50 messages per
query evaluation.

Structure <a name="p7">&#160;</a><br>
<p>
In algorithms which use only direct similarity measures, the
<tt> get-ranking</tt> program contains all of the
algorithm-specific functions in the main module.  The lower-level modules
are the same as in the <tt> process-news</tt> family of programs described
above, though there are differences in certain imported procedures.
<p>
In algorithms which use indirect similarity measures, <tt> get-ranking</tt>
imports some other mid-level modules as well.  However, the other
module hierarchies and interfaces are identical to the <tt> process-news</tt>
family of programs.

Our discussion of the Pasadena implementation has now reached the point
where we can give a somewhat more detailed description of the IR
algorithms used in the vector space ranking filtering stage <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210733im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img374.gif">.
