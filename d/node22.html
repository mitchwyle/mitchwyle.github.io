<p>
Throughout the last three decades in the IR, computer science, and
other literature, there have been repeated attempts to incorporate
phrases, i.e. combinations of words, in the automatic indexing and
retrieval processes for full text applications [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Salt83">Salt83</a>],
[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Jac92a">Jac92a</a>], [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Crof91">Crof91</a>].  The improvements gained through the use
of phrases have counter-intuitively always been quite small.  In some
cases they have produced no improvement to the retrieval process at
all.  In very small message collections, with narrow,
well-defined domains of discourse and small vocabularies, NLP methods
using linguistically parsed phrases produce significant retrieval
performance improvements [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Jaco92">Jaco92</a>].  But for larger unrestricted
collections, most simple algorithmic phrase production methods to
produce indexing features composed of more than one word have not had
much success.
<p>
<a name="6431">&#160;</a>
<a name="6432">&#160;</a>
<a name="6433">&#160;</a>
In [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Crof91">Crof91</a>], Croft et. al. analyse the major phrase production and
indexing methods reported in the IR literature, then go on to propose
and test related, slightly better methods.  Retrieval algorithms based
on their methods produce at best an 8-15% performance improvement over
methods they tested that use individual words.  The most successful
automatic phrase generation system they tested uses Ken Church's
stochastic tagger [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Chur88">Chur88</a>] which Croft et. al. employed only to
generate noun phrases.  The stochastic tagger is based on so-called
``shallow'' lexical analysis as well as probability tables of
contextual occurrence to assign parts of speech to words and also to
identify noun phrase boundaries.  This application is an example of the
maturity that the best NLP<a name="6436">&#160;</a> 
methods have obtained, as we mentioned in
section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node10.html#ir">1.4</a>.  Most methods reviewed and applied by Croft et. al.
are based on a <em> semantic</em> analysis of text, where 
the homeosemy<a name="6439">&#160;</a>
between a query text and each message in a collection is enhanced
through <em> meaningful</em> groups of words.
<p>
Our approach to the generation and use of indexing features composed of
more than one word takes a radically different approach.
Teufel<a name="6441">&#160;</a> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Teuf89">Teuf89</a>] showed conclusively that <em>
extending</em> overlapping word fragments (N-grams) based on their high
information theoretical noise<a name="6444">&#160;</a> produced a much superior set
of features (used as indexing tokens) than using a fixed-size set of
N-grams.  Intrigued by this idea and Teufel's positive results, we
decided to extend certain words into phrases based on their information
theoretic noise within individual dynamic message collections.  Words
with a high noise value relative to other words in these collections
are extended <em> symmetrically</em> to phrases and phrases with high-noise
are themselves extended to longer phrases.  Phrase construction starts
with the selection of single-word features from a query text or message
using the usual methods of word extraction, stop-list word elimination,
and word reduction as described in [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Wyle91">Wyle91</a>].
<p>
The noise of each single-word feature, the average noise, and the
standard deviation are then calculated.  Those words with a noise
value larger than the average noise plus one standard deviation are
extended to phrases.  The number of phrases constructed per high-noise
word depends on the collection frequency of the word <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img316.gif"> and on a
distance <a name="6447">&#160;</a>
parameter <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img318.gif">.  Phrases are formed from all combinations
of each occurrence of the high-noise word with <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img319.gif"> words to the
left and <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img320.gif"> words to the right of the high-noise word.  Here is
the first significant difference between Teufel's N-gram extension
scheme and our phrase construction analog.  Whereas Teufel extended
N-grams only to the right; we form phrases symmetrically.  <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img321.gif"> phrases are formed for each high-noise word.
Obviously, a large <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img322.gif"> will cause explosively many phrases to be
formed, and a small <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img323.gif"> may fail to form important phrases.  In
his automatic phrase construction experiments, Fagan [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Faga87">Faga87</a>]
found an optimal <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img324.gif"> value to be either 1 or 2, depending on the
collection, and Croft [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Crof91">Crof91</a>] verified this result.  Since we
continue to expand phrases formed by this initial step, we choose
<img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img325.gif"> for our method.  Another parameter, <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img326.gif"> is used to
handle stop-words in the source text which occur between words forming
a <a name="6450">&#160;</a>
phrase.  Up to <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img328.gif"> stop-words may appear between any two words
for phrases containing these words to be deemed identical.  Again, the
best analysis of this parameter is due to Fagan [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node40.html#Faga87">Faga87</a>] who
found the optimal value to be either 2 or 3.  For our method, experience
indicates that <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img329.gif"> provides the best results.
<p>
The noise<a name="6452">&#160;</a> 
of each phrase formed by this initial step along with the
average and standard deviation are again calculated, and phrases with
high-noise are extended to longer phrases by combining the initial
phrase with <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img330.gif"> words to the left and and <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img331.gif"> words to the
right of the phrase wherever it appears in the query text or message.
The resulting set of individual words combined with phrases constructed
from high-noise words forms the vocabulary of features <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img332.gif"> used by
the similarity measures.  Each feature <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img333.gif"> is weighted
according to equations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#eqwtipd">2.15</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node16.html#eqwtipdn">2.16</a>, and the
similarities between the query text and each message in the dynamic
collection. are calculated by equation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/node15.html#eqrsvblen">2.11</a>.  The
subscriber-specified number of messages with the highest retrieval
status values form <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img334.gif">, the resulting set of messages of
filtering stage <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img335.gif">.
<p>

<p>
Because this phrase construction method relies heavily upon information
theoretic noise, we now propose a reformulation of noise optimized for
this method.  The usual definition of the <em> noise</em> <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img336.gif"> of a

<p>
where <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img339.gif"> is the occurrence frequency of <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img340.gif"> in <b>d</b> and

<p>
For the purpose of filtering a dynamic collection of unknown size <b>N</b>
with an uncontrolled vocabulary of features <img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img343.gif">, we propose a
different formulation of <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img344.gif"> which minimizes the state
information and computational complexity required  for the incremental
calculation of <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img345.gif"> as each new query text and message arrives in
an <b>IS</b>.  The advantages of this new formulation of noise
are twofold:
<ol><li> Reduced storage requirements for state information during the
  calculation
  <li> Reduced time complexity of an algorithm implementing this equation
</ol>

<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img346.gif"><p>
<p>
<b> Proof</b>: Starting with equation <a href="node22.html#eqnoise">3.5</a>,
we note that <img align="MIDDLE" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img347.gif"> is independent of the sum and can be factored

<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img350.gif"><p>
Then we separate the sum into two sums:
<p><img align="BOTTOM" alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/19971014210126im_/http://www.vhdl.org/~wyle/diss/img351.gif"><p>

we get

QED.
<p>
As we shall see in our discussion of retrieval performance experiments,
the use of phrases generated by this scheme produces significant
retrieval performance improvements over the use of single-term features or
phrases produced by existing phrase generation methods.
<p>
In this chapter we introduced the passive subscriber model which is based on
the SDI and software agent concepts; the model includes two new methods
of human - computer interaction:  palettes of examples are used in
conjunction with a dialog system in which each message a software
system sends to a subscriber is actually a valid command which can be
interpreted by the system.  Furthermore, we presented a hybrid of the
SDI concept that uses modern IR similarity measures and dynamic message
collections.  We also defined an information server in terms of
subscriber profile parameters and individual filtering stages used to
extract information from the Matrix.  Some properties
of filtering stages were discussed in general, and four stages designed
specifically to produce better retrieval performance in an <b>IS</b> were
defined in detail.  Extensions of the commonly used formulation of
regular expressions were introduced briefly.  Finally, a new method of
automatic phrase construction for generating indexing tokens was
defined based on the noise measure, and a more efficient re-formulation
of that measure was presented.
<p>
We come now to the implementation of this proposed <b>IS</b> as well as the
retrieval experiments used to test the filtering paradigm described
here and the proposed term weighting and retrieval functions from the
last chapter.
